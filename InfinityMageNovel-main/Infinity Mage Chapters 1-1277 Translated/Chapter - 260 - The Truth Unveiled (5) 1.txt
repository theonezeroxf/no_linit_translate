[260] The Truth Revealed (5)

To think that she, who had been the principal of the Royal Magic School ten years ago, would become a vice principal at a local school.

It must be true because he is not the type to lie in front of a correspondent.

But why the hell? Did he make a choice that would destroy his career, which he had built up throughout his life, in an instant?

What the hell is going on at this school?

Alpheas was also suspicious.

Lately, though they've gotten to know each other after resolving old strife, she was stubborn about being a sympathizer.

“Olivia. you… … .”

“Stay still. We can talk about that later.”

When Olivia looked at her in frustration, Alfeas quickly shut up.

Meanwhile, Killline's eyes moved quickly. Calculations of her profit and loss ran rapidly through her head.

A minor misunderstanding brought about this situation. No, could this be called an illusion?

It was just Olivia's whim.

However, if the 2nd class archmage acted capricious, there was no choice but to adjust.

Killline hurriedly dropped to her knees and fell to the floor.

"sorry! I made a mistake without even knowing the topic. I should have sent you a message in advance, but I didn't even know Olivia was thinking that way, so... … .”

It was inevitable that it would rain.

When she can reasonably crush someone, Olivia becomes the scariest thing in the world.

Hundreds of students who studied with her are sitting in the leadership ranks of all walks of life. Not only would she get her kicked out of her teacher society if she kept her mouth open, but she could be banished from society forever.

“I will issue a correction right away. Give me one last chance! I will somehow rectify this situation.”

Olivia let out a long sigh.

If it was that easy, I wouldn't have created this atmosphere in the first place.

Magazines have already spread throughout the world, and it is impossible to collect them all. Even if it is collected, people's memories cannot be erased.

“Issuing a corrective article is to escalate the case. Don't make unnecessary issues.”

“Then what shall we do?”

Killine raised her head with tears in her eyes.

She came in with her head straight, and within 10 minutes she had become a young correspondent who had just joined the Teachers' Association.

“Do a feature article for two months. Turn your attention to provocative articles such as corruption in each school, sexual harassment of students by teachers, and organ trafficking in the wizarding community. i'll give you the sauce Sirone and Dante's names should never be in magazines.”

“Yes, yes, I will.”

"and… … Apologize to Sirone.”

Killline looked back at Sirone on her knees.

Sirone showed complex emotions on her face.

It's true that he was angry, but it was also pitiful to see the kill line where he fights and bends to protect his rice bowl.

Maybe it's because she's an adult. It's an adult's life where everything ends with one mistake.

"sorry. I'll do anything for a reward I can, please give me one more chance... … .”

Sirone didn't want to hear it.

If that's the case, I want to scream that I shouldn't have done it in the first place, but that was also futile.

It was embarrassing to see an adult fifteen years older than him crawling onto his lap and banging his head on the ground.

"That's Okay. Just go. Because it's already in the past. You can't turn it around. However, if you have a chance later, I would like you to apologize to my parents.”

“Yes, I will see you right away. I'm really sorry."

Olivia smiled bitterly.

All students would be similar, but Sirone was particularly honest. A little brainy kid wouldn't hit the kill line like this.

'Honestly, he's a kid who's far from lust for fame or money.'

The characteristic of those who have realized the immortal function is that their way of thinking is metaphysical. They have an extreme lack of thirst for the world, pursue ideals, and show deep interest in the world beyond imagination.

Whatever Syrone's tendencies, Olivia didn't want to throw the kill line.

Even in monarchies, the power of the press cannot be ignored, and she was smart.

Besides, since he had a high reputation in the correspondent world, it was far more profitable to keep him by his side than to train a new correspondent.

“Killin, you are a capable kid. Make sure you don't make this mistake again. When this work is over, let's have a meal.”

"thank you! This will never happen again!”

“Yes, go see.”

Killline bowed her head and backed away.

When this happened, Alpheas and Sirone had nothing to say.

I chose the best solution possible in the current situation, and Killin felt like falling into hell, so my heart was relieved to some extent.

Olivia turned to Sirone and said.

“I’m sorry. it's my negligence Of course, technically speaking, this inspiration is not at fault.”

Alpheas covered his mouth as if he was embarrassed and cleared his throat.

Sirone smiled.

This did not relieve all his emotions, but Olivia and Alfeas' existence was a strong support for him, who had no place to rely on.

Alpheas comforted Sirone.

“This too will pass soon. There is a final exam soon, so don't think about anything and focus on the exam. Then everything will be back to normal.”

"thank you. I will stop.”

Sirone expressed her sincere gratitude and left the principal's office.

Although all the protagonists of this incident have disappeared, there is still tension in the principal's office.

Olivia closed her eyes and thought. She then asked, looking at Alfeas.

“You really think so?”

Alpheas didn't answer.

If it's a moderately serious matter, time is the medicine. However, in the case of Sirone, the situation was different.

What they were thinking about was not that Sirone's origins were low or that they were not qualified to attend magic school.

“I will have no choice but to watch. perhaps… … Nothing may happen.”

“I guess so. but… … .”

Olivia stopped talking.

As Alpheas had said, talking about it now wouldn't change anything. I just hoped that the terrifying bomb hidden in this incident would not be revealed on the surface.

The final exam is over.

In the last semester, we went on vacation right after the exams were over, but in the second half, we had one more schedule.

It was the graduation exam of the senior class.

As it was the biggest festival of the Magic School, where all students attended, the atmosphere inside the school was lively.

Sirone's final grade was 6th in Class Four.

First place was Dante, followed by Sabina, Closer, Boyle, and Pandora.

Under Sirone, Iruki and Nade were seated.

Sirone, who had greatly strengthened the battery, which was her biggest weakness, within a year, was satisfied. On the other hand, Iruki and Nade were stunned for a while, as if shocked by how they fell behind in the theory test.

In terms of the total score combined with the practical test scores, Sirone's rank was a whopping 3rd.

Dante was first overall, followed by Iruki.

Anyway, since Dante, who took first place overall, was defeated in the 2,000th round, there were many students who took the side of Sirone by a narrow margin in the first rank of graduates.

However, in terms of reputation, it was not as good as before.

Because their origins were revealed, the children who had followed Sirone were moving away one by one.

Among them, there were people who blatantly spat words of disparagement at Sirone.

Sirone was hurt every time that happened, but he didn't show it.

Killline kept his word and no longer appeared in Spirit magazine.

According to Olivia, she went to visit her parents and knelt down to pray.

There are days in life when you fall into a bog, so Sirone thought that this was also the passing wind.

maybe it could have been

However, Sirone's article, which was published only once in Spirit magazine, came back with a huge aftermath beyond anyone's imagination.

One day, with 15 days left before the graduation exam, an incident occurred that shook the magic school.

Clap! Clap!

Up to 40 knights were fully armed and passed through Tormia's noble district. It was a soldier escorting a wagon.

The carriage, decorated with a gold crown, was large enough to eat, sleep, and pack inside.

Even the nobles of the highest ranks did not dare to frown at the march of armed troops occupying the road.

So, it was only natural that the livers of the guards guarding the main gate of the school had become the size of a pea.

When the carriage stops at the main gate, the school's security system is thrown into chaos.

The Chief of Security ran out, and after reading the document the lead driver had handed him, he ran to the principal's office, even paler than when he ran.

"principal! It's a big deal!”

As soon as the head of security knocked, he opened the door to the principal's office and entered.

Olivia's impression of hating people with no manners was wrinkled.

However, when the chief of security, who was almost fifty, looked like he was about to cry, he put his emotions aside for a while.

"What happen?"

“I-over there… … who came... … No, look at this!”

The head of security placed the document on the desk instead of explaining it verbally.

Olivia held up the document and read it carefully out of curiosity rather than nervousness.

"ha… … .”

Olivia put the paper back down and sighed as she touched her forehead.

“Uh, what should I do? Shall I let you in?”

“Of course it should. how can i get rid of it? Please guide me this way. I'll go out to meet you as soon as I'm ready."

"All right!"

The chief of security skipped even greetings and hurried away.

Olivia wanted to follow and nag him, but it wasn't that he didn't understand his feelings. She was probably numb and had no thoughts in her head.

"at last… … Things have blown up.”

Olivia rested her chin on her desk with her elbows on the desk.

The thing I was worried about finally happened, but I didn't think it would be such a great opponent.

'but… … I can't help but move Seeing an article like that.'

Maybe it's a good thing for Sirone?

Looking at his inclination, he might rather hate it, but considering his future and life, it was definitely close to a blessing.

"anyway… … I should go out and see.”

Olivia quickly changed her clothes and left the principal's office.

The students stopped and watched as the house-sized carriage crossed the garden.

The size of the wagon is amazing, but it was the first time an armed soldier with weapons entered the school.

"what? What happened?”

“Where did the war break out? Why do knights come to school?”

A murmur was heard here and there, but the knights moved on without even looking at them.

At last the carriage stopped at the center of the school building.

The knights put their hands on the handles of their swords and stood guard against their son-in-law, as if they would immediately unleash the sword at the slightest hint of something suspicious.

The students who heard the rumors gathered one by one. At last the carriage was filled with hundreds of people.

Even so, the carriage was nailed to the spot without even a slight movement.

After receiving Olivia's message, Alpheas came out to meet him first.

However, even when the former principal of the school appeared, the knights did not lose their vigilance.

“Principal, what is this? Did anything happen at school?”

Alpheas couldn't say anything to his disciples.

Even after receiving Olivia's message, he was dubious, but when he saw it with his own eyes, it was a situation that exceeded expectations.

On the roof of the chariot adorned with a gold crown stood a statue of a lion carved in gold.

There was only one country on the continent that used the symbol of a lion.

Alpheas had just come running, so he didn't hear the details, but if they came, the reason was mana.

Sirone.

It was Killline's mistake that ultimately led to this situation.

'No, should I call this a state of affairs? Maybe for Sirone... … .'

At that moment, the carriage door burst open and an old man with wide eyes came down. As the knights opened the road left and right, they stubbornly kept their mouth shut.

His gait was staggering due to his old age, but the miasma on his face was not an ordinary impression.

Escaping from the escort of the knights, he looked around at the students in the audience and took out a scroll from his bosom with a strong and arrogant expression.

The scroll was also of the finest paper and was bordered with gold.

“I am Ordos, the magistrate of the Kazura Kingdom and a messenger who came to follow the king’s orders!”
