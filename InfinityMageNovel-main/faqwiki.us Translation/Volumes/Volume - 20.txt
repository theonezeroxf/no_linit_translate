[476] As much as the way I came (3)
‘It went in!’
Gaold was sure.
The moment the thrilling Bakum Press exploded at her fingertips, the sensation that Uriel was shaken came through clearly.
It was a certainty conveyed ten million times.
Not a speck of dust remained in the vicinity, but the wrinkles in the atmosphere completely obscured the view.
As the air spread outward, an aftershock incomparable to a typhoon swarmed the battlefield, which had fallen into a momentary vacuum.
The air gathered as it rotated, turning into turbulence, creating hundreds of vortices.
Amidst the movement of the wind, I saw Yuriel, who was holding back her huge body while defending herself with the Horse of Paradise.
‘Is it really human technology?’
Having fought countless battles, Uriel also knew that superiority through inaction did not necessarily guarantee victory.
If you’re just a family, but a human with skills that even angels couldn’t predict, it wouldn’t be shameful to be pushed aside for a while.
Miro is a representative figure, but Gaold has reached this point only through inaction.
“Big!”
Gaold rushed in one after another, his graying hair fluttering.
The Bakum Press is a powerful defensive weapon, but depending on how you use it, it can also become a bomb that explodes ultra-high-density air pressure.
“Interesting.”
The goon of paradise collided with the bakum press with a roar.
As the air burned in the heat of friction, a huge cloud of fire ascended as if a bomb had exploded.
The scorching heat was transmitted to those on the wall, and Sein, who was destroying Erg’s magic circle, became even more impatient.
‘Damn it. He might be dead.’
Literally the air turned to fire.
It was so powerful that even the Gaold of the world could not help but die.
Sein shouted while activating the Sun Moon Halo.
“Cover!”
As the two gears penetrated Erg, Sein’s consciousness completely blocked out information from the outside.
Zulu and Armin arrive to protect the defenseless Sein.
The force field of slow magic unfolded, and Zulu’s summoned cougar swung sharp claws at the approaching foes.
However, as time passed, the number of fallen angels only increased.
‘This side won’t be able to last long either.’
There is no way to confirm Gaold’s life or death, and the battle on the castle wall is gradually being pushed back.
‘Is this the power of an angel?’
The difference between an angel and a fallen angel is the difference between heaven and earth, but the ability that comes out of their concept has an ideal that is differentiated from anything of a magician.
“It’s an enemy that can’t be defeated from the start.”
said Zulu, commanding the cougar.
“You just have to focus on passing the time. There is still one chance left.”
“Do you think Gaold is alive?”
“no.”
Zulu looked at Gangnan, who was fighting Urotas, a fire giant wizard, at the forefront of the battlefield.
“It is not about living and dying. It is a question of whether or not you can give up.”
thud! thud! thud!
Every time Urotas’s fist hit the ground, Gangnan felt his heart sink.
The last remaining fire giants.
However, he was the vice-captain, and he was an unusual wizard for a giant.
‘The seal of fire!’
After stopping the attack, Urotas put his palms together and cast a spell, and the seal of burning flames was engraved on Gangnan’s forearm.
“Sheesh!”
The fire immediately materialized and burned, and strength began to drain from Gangnan’s arm.
Urotas’s magic is seal art.
It was the ability to burn dominion by carving a seal where it was aimed with a gaze of fire.
Once the seal is imprinted, it is impossible to move, as if a nerve has been cut.
Determining the range of application seemed to have a fairly difficult condition, but considering that the opponent was a wizard with the strength of a giant, there was no doubt that it was an annoying skill.
“I will avenge the clan’s enemies!”
Realizing that he was not an opponent to fight only with stubbornness, Kang Nan flexibly twisted his body and dug into his opponent’s arms.
When Ram Muay’s unique linear and chauvinistic attack was applied, Urotas hurriedly widened his distance and cast the seal technique again.
As the fire burned in his right thigh and control disappeared, Kang Nan kicked the ground as if to strike with the opposite foot.
Rapidly rushing in like an arrow, she struck Urotas’ side with a kick that curved like a whip, and the giant’s body was pushed back.
“Oohhh!”
As Urotas’s eyes were burning with fire, a seal was engraved on the side of Gangnan’s stomach.
“omg!”
My heart stopped flinching as the fire burned and the dominion around me was consumed in an instant.
When Urotas punched him, Kang Nan covered his face with his arms.
A conditional reflex movement that I was able to reach at the end of countless repetitions every day.
As the shock passed through the guard, Gangnan’s consciousness was clouded.
“Keugh!”
When she comes to her senses, what she sees is the erection of the castle walls soaring toward the sky.
Tears flowed from her eyes.
‘I am… … .’
You can’t be like him.
Even though he has risked everything, he can’t even stay on the edge he reached.
“Huh!”
Kang Nan clenched his fists and stood up.
Emotions don’t matter.
Because I left everything and came here to fulfill one purpose.
“certainly… … I will definitely bring it.”
At some point, the battle on the castle wall was reaching its climax.
When Siena’s freezing magic restrained the Mara, Kuan flew in and cut the frozen body.
Ethella was blasting the giant Mara with Yin-Yang Wave Fist, and Zulu and Armin were using all their skills to block the bizarre abilities of the fallen angels.
And Sein… … Finally, we reached the central processing unit of the 1-gon Mara Erg.
A lot of circuits went through a tangled net and disconnected all the connections with the halo of the sun and moon.
As the light of the magic circles in reality gradually weakened, Kariel’s face crumpled slightly.
It’s holding up much longer than he thought.
It was a very unpleasant thing from his point of view, who considered humans as insignificant as bugs.
‘I want to wipe it out right now, but… … .’
However, Kariel’s way of thinking was different from Uriel’s.
‘There is a much simpler solution.’
Realizing that it was time to put the second plan into action, Kariel approached Miro and held out her hand.
If the magic suppression magic circle planted in her head exploded, her face would be completely blown out.
Even after guessing Kariel’s intentions, Miro just stared at the battlefield in silence.
The front of the Hall of Corruption was bumpy with large and small craters created by Gaold’s atmospheric pressure, and a deep valley formed where Yuriel’s touch touched.
‘You’ve become stronger, Gaold.’
Looking at Gaold sprawled on the floor, Miro smiled for the first time.
Gaold is strong, but he cannot defeat the Archangel.
That is the original concept.
Not 1 destruction, not 1,000 destruction, just destruction.
The universe only flows from the beginning to the end, and human beings who are late runners of the principle cannot go beyond the concept that precedes it.
‘What am I even doing like this? I’m just a woman.’
Just being able to compete with the archangel for over a minute showed how high Gaold had risen.
‘Still, to be honest, I was a little moved.’
gee gee.
Miro slowly closed his eyes as the magic circle in his head waited for the detonation and delivered an echo.
‘every… … hi.’
Gaold looked into the void with empty eyes.
‘Let’s quit.’
Have you ever poured out something like this in your entire life?
It was a sense of accomplishment that made me feel like I had achieved something even though I hadn’t accomplished anything.
‘Okay, let’s give up. It wasn’t mine from the start.’
When you think about it, it was a simple thing.
Why can’t I forget her? All you have to do is change her mind like flipping her palm.
‘I have to become the president of the association again. She’ll meet a woman much better than Maze. She could be a huge denial. You could have the most powerful power in the world. I’m sick of it.’
Gaold wept hot tears.
It will end.
If you forget the maze… … The world becomes his.
Maze only… … .
“Huh! black!”
Gaold gritted his teeth.
“shit! Because that doesn’t work… … !”
You don’t need anything.
No women, no wealth, no fame, even happiness.
“That’s why I’m doing this high school!”
maze only.
If I could laugh with her for just one day, no, even for a minute, I would pay anything.
“Damn it. Why even that… … .”
can’t you have it?
That dark heart burned his hell again and set the world in flames.
“Are you still going to try?”
Gaold stood up as he was lying down.
The nerves of his whole body wriggled like a monster, and he bent his upper body, compressing the Bakum press and popping out.
Aaaaaaaang!
Miro’s eyes opened again as the skin-melting heat raged.
Kariel also looked at the battlefield as if it were interesting, but soon opened her eyes wide and turned her head.
visor! visor! visor!
Erg’s magic circle was broken in a chain, and Sein’s consciousness returned to reality.
“Now! Go in!”
“this… … !”
Kariel accelerated the detonation of the magic circle planted in Miro’s head.
Miro’s brow crumpled at the roaring noise he heard in his brain, and cold sweat flowed from his temples.
“run! hurry!”
When Sein and his party charged at Miro, the fallen angels hurriedly rushed in and created a physical barrier.
You could tell how urgent the angels were just by looking at their determination to fill the space, unable to consider attack or defense.
After confirming the maze’s condition, Sain pressed on.
“Break it! I do not have time!”
Kuan, Ethella, and Siena opened the road with all their might.
When that very narrow, single path was pierced, everyone penetrated there.
Whoops!
One fallen angel who descended from the sky at full speed blocked the path again.
Landing almost crouched down, she raised her pupilless red eyes and grabbed her wrist.
‘Pulse barrier!’
When everyone’s biorhythms were equalized and their movement stopped for an instant, Sein’s face turned pale.
The explosive light of the magic circle was leaking through the maze’s skull.
‘late!’
“Yaaaaa!”
At that moment, a shrieking sound was heard from under the wall.
Kang Nan, who had raised one knee, flew like a cannonball and struck the fallen angel’s side face intact and left.
Probably only 0.8 seconds left before Miro’s head explodes.
Sein was the only person who could complete all the calculations in that short moment.
Sain, who had widened the gap by the speed of his nerves’ reaction, finally reached Miro through an escape route.
‘Hmph, it’s already late.’
I could see Kariel, who was thinking faster than that, raising the corner of her mouth.
‘0.4 seconds! Is it possible?’
Even installing the halo of the sun and moon was a tight time.
0.3 seconds.
The Iron Eye returned, and the world’s consciousness began to turn to Miro.
0.2 seconds.
At that moment, the Servant’s calculations made a definite decision.
‘Approximately 0.03 seconds late.’
Emotions surged faster than light, and my heart thumped.
‘Damn it… … !’
0.1 seconds.
The magic circle attached to Miro burned intensely with a radiant glow.
and… … Time has stopped.
stop.
When Armin, who covered the distance with flicker magic that transcends time and space, cast stop magic, Kariel’s mental function stopped and the detonation situation stopped in 0.1 seconds.
“uh? uh huh?”
A single tear flowed belatedly, and Sein lost his mind for a moment, putting his servanthood to shame.
But nobody can blame him.
Even in Miro’s eyes, which had maintained her composure until now, emotions were revealed.
“hurry! Escape!”
The moment Armin shouted, Sein and Miro, who had been eyeing each other, moved at the same time.
Miro held out her hand, but Sein hugged her around the waist.
‘I’m sorry, Gaold. Understand this.’
And without even having time to look back, he cast a teleportation outside the wall and flew up.
“Gaold!”
The moment Gaold, who was on the ground, looked up, Sein, who was filled with emotions, shouted, crumpling his arrogance.
“Let’s go!”

Chapter - 477 - Her name is Gangnan (1) 2.txt
===============================
[477] Her name is Gangnan (1)
Raising his head to the sky, Gaold accepted the situation without a shadow of a doubt.
In the 20 years of working on the project, did you ever really think that this was possible?
However, in those 20 years, there has never been a single day when I did not think of today’s situation, so rather than meeting and anxiety, the thought that something that had to happen had just happened was all I could think of.
‘I have to run away.’
That justification quickly changed Gaold’s thinking.
From now on, there is no need to look back.
The only task left to him was to get out of this place.
“Great!”
Gaold’s concentration completely penetrated the end of his mind and reached the realm of death, and the ruthless air press pressed down on Uriel.
Power enough to stop even the Archangel of Destruction from moving for an instant.
It was just that, but it was enough for Gaold now.
“Run unconditionally!”
Sane landed on Gaold’s back, followed immediately by another party.
Gaold turned around for the last time and caught Kariel frozen and still in the rotating gaze.
Unless the stop magic is dispelled, even an archangel cannot transcend time.
However, the group of numerous fallen angels who ran madly beyond Kariel would be different.
“Exit at full speed!”
As soon as Gaold finished speaking, the wizards cast teleportation and jumped out.
Since they were the best wizards in their respective lines, the flash left the plain in an instant and finally entered the drawbridge.
Sein cut off Miro’s leash.
Arius on a leash was cumbersome, but if he started to speed up from now on, he could get strangled and put himself in a dangerous situation.
Arius rolled on the floor and hurriedly regained his balance and went straight ahead.
Even though he lost an eye, he was once one of the 7 Madou Girls in the Black Line, so it was not a problem to run away on his own.
“Make it work!”
At Sae-in’s instruction, Kang-Nan spurred through the door of the engine room.
When she discovers a large actuator that seems impossible to pull unless she is a giant, she kicks it. Zeng! Her iron handle slammed away with her bells ringing.
It wouldn’t have much effect on the flying fallen angels, but it would have been able to block the approach of the ground-walking Maras for a while.
There was also the advantage of being able to block enemies’ ranged attacks once the drawbridge was built.
When they came out, Gaold’s party had already entered the drawbridge.
Koo Goo Goo Goo!
As the center of the drawbridge split into two, it slowly began to soar toward the sky.
It was impossible with human technology to build a whole drawbridge with a width of 1 km and a length of 4 km.
“maze! Recapture the maze!”
The fallen angels only aimed at the labyrinth and rushed at it.
They know that just grabbing her will tie everyone’s feet.
Forgetting even the lofty memories of their original angel status, the fallen angels rushed over the drawbridge as a single spear.
The bridge was filled with enemies in an instant, and another battle took place on the gradually leaning bridge.
Even if it was a fallen angel, the power of an attack with all its heart was terrifying.
Gaold and the others felt keenly how important Armin’s stop magic was in this project.
‘But the stop is now unavailable. We have no choice but to do it ourselves.’
Stopping time does not mean canceling an event.
Currently, the stop force field is hanging on Kariel, and if the force field is released, then Miro’s head will explode without even using his hands.
Meanwhile, instead of chasing Gaold, Uriel flew to the castle wall and looked after Kariel, who was trapped in a stop.
“Kariel… … .”
The maze problem was secondary to Uriel.
It was Kariel who planned all of this anyway, and Uriel was only helping him as a bystander to some extent.
However, seeing Kariel experienced a considerable psychological shock.
There was no radiance to be found in the archangel, where time stood still.
‘A mere human could incapacitate an archangel.’
The goon of paradise rotated with the sound of the wind, but I did not dare to destroy it.
He is trapped in the force field anyway, and he himself is also frozen.
‘I can’t go back right now.’
In order to accelerate to the speed of light and reverse the stopped time, you need the help of the Archangel of Light, Rayel.
“but… … .”
Uriel turned his head to Gaold and the others who were moving far away.
“I have to get back what was stolen.”
As soon as Uriel’s body turned into light, he flew in a parabolic arc to the center of the bridge, several kilometers away.
Woo woo woo woo!
When Yuriel landed, vibrations were transmitted to the soles of everyone’s feet as if they were standing on top of a wave.
The place where they are currently standing is one kilometer away from the access road of the drawbridge.
Unless Gaold and his party are easy-going people, if they deviate from the one-way street, it will be difficult to pursue them.
“It destroys your will.”
At the same time as Uriel rotated the wheel of paradise, Gaold applied the air press.
Again, the atmosphere burned and a terrifying explosion soared over the bridge.
“Aww!”
Gaold’s party was knocked over in all directions by the shock wave.
It was a result that could tell that Gaold had been pushed back in power even without seeing it with his own eyes.
Gaold, who lost all strength in his body, staggered with only his eyes fixed on Uriel.
must be kept
Even if I had to die here, I couldn’t let Yuriel pass by.
With each step, the feeling of intimidation doubled or quadrupled.
Around the time the heart-stopping energy weighed on his body, Yuriel stopped walking.
“It’s like you, Kariel.”
‘Kariel?’
The moment Gaold heard the name, he suddenly felt fear.
The moment I hurriedly turned around with a surprised expression, I heard Sein’s voice.
“It’s a maze!”
I saw Miro, who had escaped from Sein’s arms, flying high into the sky.
Flames embodied in the seals of fire blazed on her arms and legs.
Sealing-Prison of Woe.
Urotas, a fire giant magician, shouted with both hands outstretched at the drawbridge on the other side, which soared to an angle of 30 degrees.
“Uh ha ha ha ha! You did it! The small man did it, Mr. Kariel! Please remember the name of Urotas!”
He dropped the river on top of the castle wall and, following Kariel’s order, hid himself.
It was one of Kariel’s conversions, set up to recapture the labyrinth in case something goes wrong.
“no!”
Even the best party members could not handle the feeling of dejection they felt the moment they looked at the labyrinth, which was rapidly moving away from the seal technique.
Gaold took a step and fell to his knees.
My head was full of thoughts, but they were jumbled together, so it was all black.
A possibility discovered in the darkness.
“It’s a mutt!”
Gaold shouted, and Kang Nan immediately turned around.
“Ask me!”
After kicking off the ground, Kang Nan moved her legs quickly as she glared at the maze crossing the sky.
While the fallen angels returned to the maze, some of them attacked Gangnan.
thump thump! thump thump!
Kang Nan listened to the sound of his heart reaching his ears and calculated their movements.
Not even a single stop is acceptable.
Gangnan shook his upper body in front of the scenery of enemies rushing at him like leaves swept away by a storm.
As if she had entered a spinning blade, she evaded the dangerous attack by a narrow margin and ran through the camp of the fallen angels.
“Huh!”
The angle of the drawbridge was now soaring to 45 degrees.
Normal human beings would not be able to run as well as reduce their speed, but the speed of the force did not decrease at all.
‘More, faster!’
bang! bang! bang! bang! bang!
As he spurred the ground with strong leg force, the stone shattered and fragments flew backwards.
Miro had already flown to the other side, and all she could see was the sky.
“talent… … !”
Kang Nan gritted his teeth and gave more strength to his legs.
Even though it was going uphill, the acceleration increased even more, and finally, with all my might, I spurred on the broken bridge of the drawbridge, which tilted almost to the level of a cliff, and flew up.
“Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
Aaaaaaaang!
As if the tip of her leg had been caught in an explosion, the body of Gangnan was flying as it shattered.
One kilometer down, a blue river glistening in the sun passed by, and I ran, swinging my legs through the empty air.
You can see the maze disappearing beyond the drawbridge on the other side.
And beyond that, the giant Urotas was shooting a fiery gaze at him.
As the seal of fire was engraved on his heart, the blood that circulated rapidly throughout his body suddenly stepped on the brakes, and the shock was intense.
In the whitewashed spirit, the consciousness of Gangnan flowed into a time of one purpose and mission that was never forgotten.
– Gangnan?
A man asked the last descendant of the wolf tribe who was wandering in the gutter with a broken fang.
-The spirit of the wolf.
And he raised his lips slightly and said:
-That’s a great name. Gangran.
“Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
Kang Nan vomited out a groan and moved his limbs.
With a bang, the seal’s flame exploded, and my heart started beating again.
The hateful face of Urotas, staring at her in astonishment, was gradually approaching.
Gangnan is not the strongest warrior in Ram Muay. But she was the best fighter.
‘I am the last descendant of the wolf clan!’
The voice of the patriarch who had passed on the secret lingered in my ears.
-Don’t rely on fangs. Have a jaw that can be crushed like anything.
Cadde deuk!
Kang Nan’s belly, which stretched out like a bow, began to harden like a stone.
And finally, her body, shot like an arrow, passed through the maze and approached Urotas.
Ram Muay Striker – Arang’s.
“Huh!”
Kang Nan, who tightened his abdominal muscles with all his strength, pulled his elbows and knees as if crouching.
When the attack landed on the top of Urotas’ head and chin, Kwajik! With a sound, the rock-hard giant’s face shattered.
It was the jaw of a wolf that had bitten off a giant.
thud!
Kang Nan, who landed almost at the same time as Urotas fell, frowned in pain.
All the muscles in my stomach were torn, so I couldn’t even stand up.
She twisted her body, biting her molars. Then she grabbed the flying maze and activated her extra gravity.
“Huhhhh!”
The angle of the drawbridge was close to 70 degrees, and if it tilted just a little more, everything would be over.
For the first time, Kangnan and Miro, who were spinning almost vertically clinging to the bridge, were able to make full eye contact.
Miro doesn’t know who Gangnan is.
But for a brief moment, the emotion in her eyes said it all.
‘Okay, this kid… … .’
Miro shook his head even while being caught up in the centrifugal force.
don’t throw yourself away What to really throw… … .
When he gave the signal that the maze was no longer possible, Gangnan put on a dry smile on his lips in a fleeting moment.
But soon, like a warrior of the wolf tribe, he twisted his nose and exploded in spirit.
“Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
Throw the maze into the air with all your might! With the sound of the wind, he began jumping over her legs, tracing the trajectory of her body in reverse.
‘The ugly duckling… … .’
Finally, Gangnan’s feet fell off the bottom of the drawbridge and began to fall as far down as the length of the bridge.
‘If you call me mutt one more time… … .’
Kang Nan, whose body was turned upside down, could no longer catch the consciousness of moving away and slowly closed his eyes.
The last things she remembered were the faces of countless fallen angels pouring down from the sky.

[478] Her name is Gangnan (2)
Gaold looked up at the sky and waited.
The bridge, which had a much higher slope than when Gangnan started, now formed an almost vertical cliff.
Therefore, the height is a whopping 2 kilometers.
It was the perfect height for Miro, who was a warrior and could not use magic, to fall and die.
But that was also the story when I crossed the drawbridge.
Uriel hadn’t taken action yet, but that actually bothered him even more.
“Damn it.”
He doesn’t pay the slightest attention to Gaold’s group.
What he pays attention to is only one thing in all of humanity, the labyrinth.
And finally, when the maze climbed over the bridge to reveal itself, Yuriel reacted.
When you get back the maze, everything is back to square one.
He didn’t know how he would have judged Kariel, but this time he believed that his intellect and his intuition would match.
cooong!
As the drawbridge rocked and Uriel soared vertically, Gaold followed.
A new hope sprouted as the maze came back, but that bud was rotten somewhere.
‘mutt… … .’
Gangnan could not cross the bridge.
By blowing up the maze, he faithfully performed his duty.
My heart was pounding and a strange fire welled up in my heart.
It is truly a flame different from desire.
It was another hell that Gaold experienced for the first time in his life, different from anger or hatred.
“Aaaaaaa!”
As the air press pressed down on the atmosphere, the speed of Yuriel, who had been flapping his wings of light and soaring, rapidly decreased.
Chiyiying!
Uriel turned to Gaold, spinning his halo of destruction.
To be honest, Gaold was a nuisance.
Any opponent who can match you can happily compete with each other.
Conversely, if it is a weak enemy, destroying it is enough.
that vague borderline.
An existence that would rise up again no matter how trampled it was, and yet could not harm itself.
Uriel thinks.
Maybe that’s the confusing nature of human beings.
Good and evil, life and death, strength and weakness were all mixed together, so human beings were a mass of contradictions that could not be defined.
‘Right.’
Uriel suddenly realized.
Why didn’t I try to end them by unleashing all power?
‘It was scary.’
The fact that I could not produce results even if I gave all my strength to these weak creatures was reluctant.
‘Anchera, the reason you were wary of humans… … .’
Gaold’s air gun hit Uriel directly.
It was a powerful attack that could pierce even iron, but to the Archangel of Destruction, it was just tingling.
In the midst of that slightly unpleasant stimulus, Uriel delved deeper into his thoughts.
It excites Kariel, the highest peak of intellect, and makes him, the embodiment of destruction, hesitate to destroy.
‘Human chaos… … .’
Finally, Uriel came to a conclusion.
‘It collapses the absoluteness of the world.’
“Great!”
Gaold’s speaker was hitting Uriel’s body more powerfully and quickly.
For the first time, pain can be defined, of course, angels do not even have such a definition, but the moment Uriel’s starlight body expanded to an enormous size, the moment he felt a sense that could be guessed like that.
“I am absolute.”
Infinite Justice Halo – Ragnarok.
As the concept of destruction was integrated into Halo, white electricity spread out in all directions.
‘I can’t stop it.’
A thought flashed through Gaold’s mind, and before he knew it, his hand was outstretched toward the maze.
Pulling her with an air net, Gaold rushed to the ground with all his might.
Uriel destroyed the Gon of Paradise.
His body, surrounded only by the concept of destruction, was a weapon of its own existence, not requiring any tools.
“Oohhhhh!”
Uriel fell vertically.
The moment his body surrounded by white electricity became a flash of light and fell on the bridge, Zulu’s summoning magic was activated.
Space-Time Bird-Posmetry.
The frictional heat from Yuriel’s fall generated an enormous amount of heat, evaporating everything made of matter.
Only a hemispherical crater with a diameter of 5 kilometers remained in the place where the sphere of light, which was born and disappeared in an instant, disappeared.
Literally total destruction.
Standing in the center of the hemisphere, Uriel slowly raised his head and looked at the sky.
That’s why I didn’t want to do it.
“human… … .”
I was stabbed in the back again.
What was it?
A huge bird made of light that appeared to Gaold and the others at the moment of destruction.
As the bird enveloped everyone, the concept of destruction was not conveyed, as if they had passed into another dimension.
“What about Kariel?”
Yuriel immediately flew up and landed on top of the walls of the Hall of Corruption in an instant.
I saw Kariel, who was still trapped in the stop force field and did not even move.
All the fallen angels flew and knelt before him.
Everyone trembled at the guilt of not recapturing the maze, but Uriel asked as if he didn’t care.
“What happened to her?”
The fallen angel in the rear said as he dropped the fainting Gangnan to the ground.
“Once I got hold of it. I thought it would be better to capture them alive… … .”
If it was Kariel, he would have praised it.
Because I think everything in the world is worth using and can create new value.
On the other hand, Uriel, the archangel of destruction, didn’t like that.
It’s not just being ignorant.
He was an absolute devastation, and in front of him all values became worthless.
“What should I do?”
Uriel turned around.
“I will go to Leil.”
You must bring the Archangel of Light and bring Kariel back.
“Let humans take care of themselves.”
Leaving those words behind, Uriel disappeared into the sky.
The fallen angels, whose commander had disappeared, hung their shoulders with sullen expressions.
If he had made a contribution in this battle, it would not have been impossible to return to Pyeongcheonsa, but in the end everything ended in failure.
“There is still a chance.”
The fallen angel with blonde hair hanging down to her chest like a veil said.
“Let’s hold this woman hostage and negotiate.”
The fallen angel with sharp fangs snorted.
“Is it really possible? What’s important to them is the maze. This woman has no value as a hostage. Rather, it is an act of getting even a small pleasure by harassing them to their heart’s content and resolving their anger.”
“That’s not a good way either.”
A stout fallen angel intervened.
“But ignoring even the slightest possibility is not effective. No, maybe the solution is here.”
“What are you talking about?”
“Human beings have something called jeong. In other words, you have a tendency to understand the pain of others as your own.”
“Right.”
The blonde-haired fallen angel nodded and looked down at Gangnan with cold eyes.
“The point is, it’s fine if you don’t kill it, right?”
Kang Nan was still in a deep sleep.
* * *
The flash of space shift landed in the forest with a roar.
Casting without fully understanding the terrain is tantamount to committing suicide, but Gaold and the others were not in a position to argue.
“Keuuugh!”
At the same time as it fell to the floor, it rolled across the floor at a tremendous speed, but no one lay down and spread.
Immediately centered, they cast teleportation and dug deeper into the forest.
You have to go a little farther away.
It was so terrifying that the moment it was caught, it imprinted death in the deepest part of the brain.
If it wasn’t for the postmetry that I saved until the end, no one would be alive by now.
“Gaold! I have to go back!”
Caught by Gaold, Miro struggled and shouted.
“I have to go back, you fool!”
“shut up. Stay calm.”
Gaold’s voice was harsh.
For 20 years, I’ve been living with only saving the maze in my head.
And now Miro is in his arms.
The stopped clock started to turn, and everything that happened from now on was a terrifyingly terrifying white future for Gaold.
The expression “lost” was accurate.
I couldn’t judge anything, I didn’t even know what fear was running through my heart.
“I can save it now! As long as I’m here, you won’t be able to kill me carelessly!”
“shut up.”
The maze was frustrating.
There’s really no way you don’t know. So Gaold was making the wrong decision.
“You idiot, he wants you… … .”
Gaold’s eyes flashed with electricity, and he opened his mouth wide enough for his jaw to fall off, screaming.
“Shut up!”
The group’s footsteps stopped.
Gaold, who rolled his eyes in confusion, threw the maze roughly on the floor and turned around.
“Damn it!”
When I punched the tree trunk with my fist, the bark splattered, and I felt a lot of pain.
Still, one thought stuck in my head.
Gangran. Gangnan was captured.
What bothered him more than anything was the fact that she was sure to be alive at this moment.
For the party, Kang Nan was only a brief relationship to proceed with this project, but Gaold was different.
The moment he wasn’t there for the first time, he realized that Kang Nan was always by his side.
“I am a warrior of the wolf clan. You acted according to your convictions. She made a choice, and we have to respect that.”
“Don’t talk nonsense.”
Miro jumped up from his fallen position and grabbed Gaold by the collar.
“Wake! You can save it now! This has nothing to do with me!”
Except for Gaold, the feelings of the party were like a maze.
If you can save it, you must save it.
But no one was able to get a word out of their mouth.
Since Gaold had been living in hell for 20 years, Gaold’s judgment was the top priority unless he could share even a 1/10th of his pain.
Sein lied for a friend for the first time.
“What I decided to do when I came here is that the project comes first in any situation. Miro, we all risked our lives to save you. Even if you tell me to come and break that rule, it is not easy.”
Miro glared at Sein, then turned back to Gaold.
“What do you think? is this really what you want? Is it your choice to drive that child to death because you want me?”
Gaold was still speechless.
Like a child born into the world, thoughts were not going anywhere.
Miro, who had been looking at him pathetically, turned Gaold’s chin back and shouted.
“Look at me! Look into my eyes!”
Gaold’s gaze moved slowly to her.
The feeling that something had completely escaped lingered in his pupils.
“Are you so afraid? Are you saying you’re going to abandon that child, fearing that what you’ve done for 20 years will go to waste!”
“I am… … .”
Before he could finish his words, Miro pulled Gaold by the neck and kissed him.
With eyes shaking in shock, Gaold reflexively pushed Miro away.
“what are you doing! Do you look like a joke situation?”
Miro didn’t give up, approached again, grabbed Gaold’s wrist, and brought it to his chest.
“Just do it here. take me! Then go get her, you fool!”
Gaold distorted his expression.
This guy and that guy, everyone was making a fool of themselves.
“You me now… … !”
At that time, a beautiful voice mingled with many voices spread from the sky.
It was the ability called gospel that angels spread as a group.
-Tell the human carrying the maze. We are holding on to your clan. If you don’t bring Maze back by noon tomorrow, I’ll kill you. Keep in mind that the sooner she goes, the less pain she will suffer. deliver the last we are… … .
Gospel repeated the same words and disappeared.
It was a huge sound, but it was a neat finish without even an echo.
Gaold staggered and sat down on a rock, biting his thumb nail, lost in thought.
noon tomorrow
‘Time is running out.’
Fallen angels are taboo breakers, and Mara under their command is extremely ferocious.
Even at this moment, he had no idea what Gangnan was doing.
aww cringe
Gaold’s teeth gnawed at the fingernails in an instant and began to gnaw through the flesh and the bones of the thumb.
aww cringe
No one was able to talk to the grotesque self-harm of a human with 1,000 times the basic pain.

Chapter - 479 - Jikji (1) 1.txt
===============================
[479] Jikji (1)
Flew brought his injured body and stood in front of Shirone.
Among the 72 classes of fairies, Mirka, who is in the 2nd class, had an aesthetic power different from that of an angel.
If the beauty of an angel is huge and reverent, Mirka’s beauty comes from the color of a cute fairy tale.
Of course, none of that mattered to Flew.
It was naked and the pain of the burns ran through the nerves and scratched the brain in real time, but the professional mage’s mental strength undoubtedly created a spirit zone.
“Sheesh, I knew that. Somehow, I felt uneasy.”
Fleur’s gaze turned to Peope, who was assisting Mirka.
Do you feel any remorse?
Feope kept her head down from start to finish, but that made Fleur even more angry.
The awe-inspiring fairy Mirka approached with a solemn face.
“A bunch of insignificant humans disturbing heaven and harassing countless subjects. Get your aura right now and ask for forgiveness. And leave the world clean.”
“Peope.”
When Shirone called her name, ignoring Mirka, Peope shrugged and slowly raised her head.
There was deep fear in those big eyes.
In front of the feeling of fear of hurting Shirone, Shirone said nothing more.
It’s not that he didn’t doubt Peope. But even that doubt was erased from his head.
because she… … .
‘Because he tried to die for me.’
The scene where she willingly gave her life for herself at Jebul was still lingering in Shirone’s mind.
‘No, it’s not like that.’
Shirone suddenly realized.
Perhaps, on the other side of my heart, I thought that this was what I wanted.
The battle with Heaven is inevitable, and in the end, the two of them have no choice but to become enemies.
And with this, the hearts thrown at each of them were recovered.
“Peope.”
Feope still had no answer.
He was just waiting for Shirone’s words with fear or even a hint of anticipation.
As magic power amplification, one of the functions of the Diamond Armament, occurred, Shirone’s robe fluttered terribly.
“I will kill you.”
When Shirone spoke, as if to firmly root her own true feelings, a cold killing spirit penetrated the spirits of the fairies.
It was the same with Peope who felt the chills from Shirone’s life.
However, her face also soon became cold, and that’s how we closed each other’s hearts.
“Do it if you can. I am not what I used to be.”
Undoubtedly, Peope has become stronger.
When Shirone first came to heaven, she was the youngest of the fairies, but now she holds a position that corresponds to the middle class among the 72 classes.
The reason for his high-speed rise in status was mainly due to his relationship with Shirone.
As the riot that started in Sharmain accelerated, the Ministry of Internal Affairs used Peope, and while studying various spirits from high-level fairies, he rapidly improved his skills.
That’s why you can’t ignore the internal government.
When Shirone returned to heaven, she was more excited than anyone else, but in the end, the ones she chose were the fairies of heaven who accepted her.
“Arrest Shirone.”
When Mirka held out her hand, dozens of fairies flew from behind.
Shirone and Fleur stepped back and surveyed their surroundings.
It was best to go to Arabot as soon as possible, but the skills of the fairies around her were not so good.
Even without exchanging glances, the energy of the flu was transmitted.
It was a situation where I needed a timing to get out of here and an opportunity to predict that timing.
“Wait!”
At that time, the incarnation was broken by Shirone, and Dana, who was delirious, knelt down to Mirka.
“I am the great Eternal. Please save me! They tried to kill me!”
Mirka looked at Dana pathetically.
The reason Anchera is wary of humans is because they have the ability to actively seek death.
When they begin to actively plan death, humans become more than human.
However, after gaining eternal life, Dana lost her greatest strength as a human being.
Of course, not all Eternals are as weak as her.
In fact, it is known that the members of the Church of the Ten Lords, who are over 10,000 years old, are out of the yoke of life and death.
“A foolish thing. What greatness is there in a creature like you? You too are sentenced to death for the crime of scorning the grace of Ra.”
execution.
Once more, Dana’s avatar screamed as words that Dana should never have heard penetrated her brain.
The fear she felt because she hadn’t thought about dying in a thousand years completely destroyed her half-mad mind.
“I hate it!”
Dana raised her magic with all her might.
The madman’s mana resonated with his mind and soared endlessly, but he could not find any purpose because he had no reason.
Even so, a strong current of air could be sensed surrounding it.
“no! you die!”
Dana’s head snapped back as she held out her hands and cast an ancient spell.
The spiral fairy Peope quickly rotated her neck with the power of a powerful spiral and completely ripped her from her body.
The moment Dana’s shocked face soared through the air, Shirone and Fleur realized at the same time.
‘Now!’
As the bodies of the two turned into light and soared into the air, Mirka shouted.
“Follow me! We have to catch it in Shehakim!”
Arabot is the most sacred land in heaven where Ankera resides.
The infiltration of humans from the perspective of the fairies was an unprecedented figure in the history of the internal government.
Even though it happened unconsciously, there was no hesitation in the movements of the fairies.
At the same time as dozens of fairies chased after Shirone, fairies flew up from all sides of Shehakim like flocks of birds.
This made it clear that key figures in the interior government were keeping an eye on Shehakim.
“Peope… … .”
There was no doubt that the main person in the case was Peope.
His identity had already been discovered, and with all the fairies chasing after him, the only option left was to infiltrate Arabot at the shortest distance.
“Shirone, go first!”
Flew, who was injured, could not keep up with Shirone’s flight speed.
Thinking that even one person had to escape, she stopped flying and turned around.
Numerous fairies were running towards her.
Activated by the Dawkins Algorithm, she ignited the flames of the flames while avoiding the magic of the fairies.
Shirone, who flew up vertically, spotted Fleur struggling in the distance and launched photon cannons in all directions.
However, there were well over 100 fairies flying into him as well.
Like the angels’ abilities, they didn’t apply a few levels of logic, but the fairies’ magic, which had their own affection, was threatening enough.
It was impossible to evade all attacks even with Armand’s body strengthening ability, and as Ringer’s skin was activated, the robe turned into heavy, super-strong metal.
“Huh!”
Shirone, who could not handle the weight, spread his wings through artificial brains and others.
When the wings of light hit the air with a bang, his body stretched out dozens of meters in an instant.
The air sparkled in iridescent light with all sorts of magic, and the fairies meticulously drove Shirone to one place, repeating assembly and separation.
Without knowing how far she had flown or where she was now, Shirone defended herself from the fairies’ attacks with all her might.
At that moment, there was a popping sound from where Fleur was, and she saw her body fall to the ground.
“Seniors!”
The moment Shirone was about to jump out, the sleeve on his right arm spun rapidly and twisted as if breaking his arm.
“Aww!”
When the robe was tightened to the point of tearing, Ringer’s skin activated and turned into super-strong metal.
It was only after the rotation stopped that Shirone looked ahead.
Feope, who raised her eyes fiercely, was activating her ability toward herself.
“Ei-i-i-ik!”
Feope did her best to infuse the power of the spiral.
It was definitely an incredibly strong mana, but Ringer’s skin didn’t budge.
‘Senior Fleur.’
Flue had already disappeared from the empty landscape.
For now, I could only hope that she had been spared.
“Peope!”
Shirone gritted his teeth and extended Armand’s tentacles.
As soon as the two tentacles appeared, they exploded due to the power of the spiral, but Kenser’s absolute restoration ability quickly created new tentacles.
As afterimages bent like whips flew in, Feope couldn’t stand it and retreated.
At the same time, all the fairies that had caused Fleur to crash began attacking Shirone.
Fleur’s enemy.
A fire soared from Shirone’s chest, but the sorcerer’s cool-headed reason quickly killed the embers.
But that didn’t mean he forgot his anger.
“catch! You can kill me!”
The moment the fairies cast magic around Shirone, Shirone’s eyes flashed open.
‘Santan movement!’
Puff puff puff puff!
Huge flashes of light spread in eight directions.
When one of the fairies fell without being able to avoid it, the flash of teleportation sharply broke and sprinted there.
The bullets spread countless times, and in an instant, the air became a tangled web of photon cannon flashes.
The power of the Photon Cannon with Galtomic’s magic amplification was on a different level than before, so most fairies were in a hurry to avoid it.
Feope stared blankly at the sight of numerous comrades falling.
It was a force that was on a different level from the ones that were harassed by the fairies even when they stopped Ilhwa’s alcohol in Area 73.
In particular, the fairies in this place were all fairies with powerful minds, located in the middle of the 72nd class, unlike back then.
“Follow me! Don’t stop!”
Even while his colleagues were being bombed, the fairies flew endlessly.
With its wide wings wide open, Shirone engaged in a dogfight in harmony with the fairies with its flamboyant movements.
“this… … !”
The fairies later found a red dot between their eyebrows and gritted their teeth.
When the homing photon cannon equipped with a seeker was fired, the fairies surrounding Shirone dispersed all at once.
However, the Homing Photon Cannon relentlessly pursued the fairies, and in the distant sky, screams of despair and explosions erupted.
‘Can’t even block this many fairies?’
According to the report of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, when Ilhwa’s drinking was stopped, Shirone’s fighting power was enough for a unit of 65th-class fairies to block it, but now, even if dozens of 40th-class fairies attacked, they were in a position to worry about annihilation.
‘Goes! To Arabot!’
Shirone flapped her wings to the maximum and accelerated.
The fairies with weak mental power gradually moved away from each other, and finally no fairies caught up with him.
– Pathetic things.
The moment she thought she had completely won the speed battle, a fairy’s voice spread in Shirone’s head.
The second-class Mirka flew in with a blue flash and blocked the way before I knew it.
Shirone launched 16 homing photon cannons and fired them all at her.
She held out her hand the moment it flew away, drawing a curve like a flash of light.
Eating Out – The Razor of Truth.
Around Mirka, blades as thin as thread glittered at great speed, and the homing photon cannons were all slammed into place.
Puff puff puff puff!
Shirone raised her wings and abruptly stopped herself.
‘This… … ?’
As if not in the slightest shock, Mirka was still flapping her wings with her hands out.
‘I didn’t block it. What kind of ability.’
A fairy’s durability is never strong.
Even if it was the 2nd class, it was impossible to stand still after being hit by 16 shots of the Photon Cannon, which had been strengthened by magical power amplification.
“This has been clearly decided.”
Mirka looked at the confused Shirone and spoke solemnly.
“There is absolutely no variable that allows you to beat me.”

Chapter - 480 - Jikji (2) 3.txt
===============================
[480] Jikji (2)
‘Never win?’
Shirone didn’t listen to Mirka’s words.
I thought that the reason she was able to survive even after being hit directly by the photon cannon was because she used the rules of the fairy, and if that was the case, what she was saying now would not be a simple bluff.
‘What is it?’
Shirone fired the homing photon cannon once again.
As expected, Mirka did not dodge, and the photon cannon exploded with a powerful impact sound.
Seeing Mirka slightly raising the corner of her mouth, Shirone realized something new.
it wasn’t blocked
It was completely immune to the attack itself.
“Then can I survive this too?”
Shirone fired a laser that became more powerful through magical power amplification.
No matter how durable a material is, it can’t block the laser that causes molecular vibration forever, but this time, Mirka was just receiving the magic without the slightest shake.
Only then did Shirone stop attacking.
‘It’s embarrassing.’
I don’t know what kind of activation principle it was, but Mirka’s eating out of the rules was a very simple yet powerful ability.
“invincibility… … is that?”
Mirka nodded obediently.
“Yes. Because you are weaker than me, you can never defeat me.”
Mirka’s razor blade of truth is activated by first receiving an opponent’s attack with obvious murderous intent.
When the ability is activated, a judgment of comparative advantage against the strength of the two targets begins, and if you win there, you become invincible and unaffected by any attack from the opponent.
The determination of comparative advantage is due to the existence of the incarnation, not measurable numbers, and there is no way to reverse the invulnerability status because the razor of truth completely eliminates the anomalies and variables that may occur in battle.
In actual battle, it is an established theory that the one who wins is the strongest, but it can be defined that Mirka’s eating out of the rules has been distorted into pure strength, that is, the strong one wins by removing all variables during battle.
In order to establish this powerful concept, a difficult price must be exchanged on an equivalent basis, but if you move out of Mirka’s line of sight, the judgment is canceled, and even if you are locked in line of sight, the maintenance time is only about 30 minutes.
However, the most risky cost was that of having to stand by defenselessly against the first attack with obvious murderous intentions.
If Mirka loses in the judgment of comparative advantage, not only is it attacked, but the razor of truth is activated in reverse, and the opponent becomes invincible against itself.
In other words, when you meet an enemy who is pushed back by the power of pure incarnation, death and defeat equivalent to almost 100% await.
A fatal condition that is quite balanced as an equivalent exchange to realize the extreme state of invincibility.
However, Mirka never doubted her abilities.
And she was currently ranked 3rd in the 72nd class of fairies.
“shall we start?”
Mirka attacked Shirone without being harsh.
Eating out – the law of obedience.
Another regulation hypocrisy linked to the razor of truth was triggered.
As Mirka burrowed into Shirone’s pit at high speed, a loud shock spread through her body.
‘how?’
Even when it was difficult to breathe, Shirone had doubts.
The skin of Ringer, a type of armored mineral, was not applied.
Also, it was too strong a physical force to be called the power of a fairy.
‘This is also an ability.’
Shirone’s prediction was correct.
In the Razor of Truth, when Mirka has a comparative advantage, the Law of Obedience, which is activated, can neutralize all of the opponent’s attacks and push back all of the forces generated as a reaction.
In other words, it was a hit with twice the critical rate, so it was not a shock that Shirone, who was in a bare-body state, could not withstand if it was a physical attack from Mirka, who was absolutely invincible.
Mirka continued to attack Shirone with physical bullets.
As long as she faced Shirone, her body was invincible, so her attacks were not harsh.
While receiving the impact of being hit by a heavy rock, a thought passed through Shirone’s head.
Can’t win.
From experience, I have come across numerous regulations eating out, so various options that are expected to be broken laws came to my mind.
Among them, there was an answer that said it would be okay to get out of sight, but that was not the point.
She is a fairy of the 2nd rank among the 72nd rank.
The razor of truth was an ability that could not be defeated in the first place, unless she had a strength that surpassed that of other incarnations of fairies.
When Mirka tied Shirone’s feet, countless fairies followed and cast all sorts of magic.
Except for Mirka’s attack, Armand had blocked most of the impact, but any defense had to be limited by continuous hits.
‘Eating out of the rules is a problem.’
The ability to block the variables that occur during battle at the source.
For Shirone, who had been able to defeat opponents stronger than herself with her powerful insight and improvisation, it could be said that her ability was close to her natural enemy.
“This is the end.”
Mirka fell vertically and landed a physical attack on Shirone’s ship.
“Ouch!”
I could hear my abdominal muscles tearing and I couldn’t breathe.
The sky darkened from the edge, and two-thirds of the field of view turned into darkness.
“Now! Pour it all out!”
Armand resonates with the caster’s consciousness, so as Shirone’s consciousness weakens, its function tends to decline.
The fairies, who confirmed that the tentacles were hanging like water-soaked grass, poured out their magic.
I was thinking of completely severing my consciousness, and my life would end before I even crashed to the ground.
The fairies’ all-out attack came through the narrowed field of view.
Looking at the colorful magic that was flying around, Shirone squeezed out her last strength.
Judicial Halo – Valhalla Action.
As the halo rotated, one type of magic was calculated in an instant.
Judicial Halo – Super Magical Amplification, Ataraxia.
As the gigantic halo spread out in front, the fairies who were facing Shirone clutched their heads in shock and screamed.
The only one who could look at it was Mirka, who was already invincible.
“this… … .”
Seeing Ataraxia integrated at the moment of birth, she shouted at the fairies everywhere.
“Avoid everyone!”
As the photon cannon passed through Ataraxia, a massive flash of light completely filled the sky.
All of the magic that was pouring in its power was swept away, and the fairies trapped within the radius evaporated in an instant like flies burned by flames.
“Keugh!”
When the flash disappeared, no fairies except Mirka remained.
Mirka looked away in search of Shirone, who had disappeared from sight, but gave up and gnashed her teeth.
Archangel Ikael’s proprietary patent, Ataraxia.
Even though he knew he was invincible, he couldn’t bear to take any action and waited because of instinctive fear located at the starting point of his mind, not ability.
‘There’s no way I’m alive. I fell from this height… … .’
I would like to think so, but it was unpredictable.
“Find it. Never stop searching until you dismember his corpse.”
At Mirka’s instruction, all surviving fairies rushed to the ground.
I was even more annoyed that the place I was currently flying in was the Valley of Whales, which was famous for being the most difficult in Shehakim.
‘I definitely should have ended it.’
The face of the third-ranked fairy was not so bad.
In any case, since it was the past, Mirka immediately put aside her lingering feelings and quickly flew to the valley following her subordinate fairies.
‘Calm down. You can’t lose consciousness.’
As she fell down the valley, Shirone fought with all her might to keep her spirits up.
It was a truly formidable concentration created in a situation no different from a dying state for an ordinary person.
As long as consciousness is maintained, even if you fall, Armand will recover to some extent.
However, if the spirit breaks here, no one can guarantee what will happen after that.
thud! thud!
I didn’t feel any pain.
However, a dull impact hit the back of Shirone’s head.
After colliding with the cliff in the valley, Shirone was thrown off and hit the opposite wall again and fell.
Shirone with her eyes closed and blood dripping from her forehead.
There were only 500 meters left to the ground.
It is obvious that if you fall headfirst, you will break your neck.
At that time, one fairy flew to Shirone at a terrifying speed, avoiding the sharp rocks in the valley.
It was Peope, the fairy of the spiral.
“Ei-i-i-ik!”
I grabbed Shirone’s robe and pulled it up with all my might, but the inertial force of the fall was too strong.
I tried dispersing the falling force using spiral magic, but it was all about slowing it down.
“Huhhhh!”
Feope gritted her teeth as she felt the pain of her shoulder blade coming off.
thud!
At the same time that Shirone fell to the ground, her body bounced off and rolled on the floor.
But before she even had time to feel the pain, she flew to Shirone.
“Shirone! Shirone!”
Unconscious and unable to move, Peope, who was frightened, hurriedly put her ear to her chest.
throbbing.
My heart is beating weakly.
Sooner or later even this will stop, but I still felt some relief.
“Oops, this is not the time.”
It was only a matter of time before the other fairies were discovered as they began to scour Whale’s Valley.
Peope, who grabbed the robe and looked around, found a cave that was barely big enough for one person to enter and dragged Shirone into it.
“Whoa, it’ll be fine for a while.”
After wiping off her sweat, Peope stared blankly at Shirone’s sleeping face.
The reason she was able to track this far was because she hadn’t seen Ataraxia.
For some reason… … I knew what Shirone was going to do.
“of course.”
Feope smiled sadly.
“Because we are friends.”
In fact, did he know that he wanted to choose Shirone over the internal government?
Will he understand how he had to take the opportunity to quickly rise from being the youngest member of the 72nd class of fairies, who was treated with disdain, to becoming a leader?
“Shirone, I… … .”
Feope’s eyes were wet as she was choosing what to say.
“I became strange after meeting you.”
I didn’t say I love you.
No matter how pure the words were, I would not have said it if I had known that it was an act of throwing my heart.
I learned more emotions from high-ranking fairies.
The more she did, the more she threw out a word, like a spectrum transmitted through a prism, spreading out into a full-color rainbow with various properties and fluttering in her heart.
“Still, I do not regret my choice.”
It was a good thing that I chose the home government.
“Girin said that humans and fairies cannot fall in love. because i… … .”
Feope smiled broadly, sublimating the sadness that seemed to explode her heart into laughter.
“Because it is too small.”
However, his voice was locked, and hot tears flowed endlessly from his big eyes.
Armand’s diamond armament was lifted and changed into the form of a demonic sword.
Consciousness is completely cut off.
Shirone’s body was not intact.
There were dark bruises where the bones were broken, and even the function of the organs was heading toward death.
Feope looked at her with pity, then flew towards Shirone’s face.
Then she knelt down under his chin and caressed his cheek.
The time we met was short, but I couldn’t say I knew anything about him.
I have no more regrets because I have already thrown it away.
“I’m sorry, Shirone.”
Feope’s body as she closed her eyes and kissed Shirone’s mouth began to burn with a dazzling light.
It was an act of pouring out all of one’s lifespan and concentrating it into a single vitality.
“love you.”
With a concept she realized more clearly than a year ago, Feope threw her heart into Shirone once again.

[481] Jikji (3)
Shirone was sitting in the grass and looking at the lake.
The lake was white as milk and as calm as in the middle of a windless land.
His eyes were fixed on the horizon above the surface of the water.
-What are you looking at?
‘Ikael.’
The water surface convexly rose from the center of the lake and changed into the shape of Ikael.
The immaculate liquid that flowed smoothly across the surface disappeared, and Ikael’s image appeared as if it were a real thing.
-What are you looking at?
‘father. mom.’
Ikael collapsed like a sandcastle flowing down, and the Vincent couple took his place.
‘Rian. Amy. friends.’
The calm surface of the water began to shake as if it had met a storm.
Countless forms of people floated to the surface, completely filled with allies and enemies, loved ones and haters.
-What are you looking at?
The milky liquid coalesced and transformed into the shape of a gigantic Mirka.
I was properly hit by her diet eating out, which fundamentally blocks variables.
But was it really an enemy that could never be defeated?
Marsha’s advice that there are no absolutes when it comes to eating out passed through my head.
‘Who is it?’
Shirone suddenly lifted her head and looked into the air.
Who are you?
The voice that asked you a question from earlier.
-In fact, seeing is nothing more than a process of confirming that something is already there or not.
The voice was as bland as air.
I wondered if the information for a specific reason was being conveyed in the form of a voice in my head.
Ultima System.
The one-dimensional integrated information system that permeated Shirone’s brain was operating in a state of suspended animation.
So, the voice you hear now is a message from someone who has already left this world.
However, since the message is buried in eternal time, it is the same as hearing it right now.
-To truly see is to see something that exists there in its pure state.
‘As it is in its pure state.’
the voice asked again.
-What are you looking at?
Defeat. Peope’s betrayal. Flu’s well-being.
All those emotions floated to the surface.
No, I’m not looking at it. An illusion of thought created simply because I want to see it, or because I thought I had to see it.
“I am… … What are you looking at?”
All forms on the surface of the water began to collapse.
“I am not watching anything.”
said the voice.
– When you are not looking at anything, you can finally see everything.
The lake sank calmly again.
Eventually, as the water surface lowered, the white liquid disappeared, and the world disintegrated into small pieces, scattering like cherry blossoms and disappearing out of sight.
The Ultima System, which had permeated like a ghost in the brain’s network, was finally systematized and installed to the nerve endings.
At the same time, Shirone’s incarnation shone for a moment, foreshadowing his mental change.
If the blind direction of the cerebral synapses creates concentration and that concentration is realized as the Spirit Zone, Shirone’s Spirit Zone equipped with the Ultima System is manifesting as something unique and unique with a different temperament than before.
‘This is it…’ … .’
Jikji.
One gaze looking straight at the whole world.
The scenery that had nothing to do with it returned to its original place and unfolded before Shirone’s eyes.
The lake was still calm, but now Shirone’s eyes were clearly conveying the numerous possibilities of cartooning as if they were living creatures.
-What are you looking at?
Shirone replied.
“eventuality.”
The voice spoke as if answering.
-That’s what Ultima is… … .
Flash!
Shirone’s eyes widened as if shocked by the intense flash of light applied to her brain.
‘What happened?’
A vague memory like a dream.
But the image itself was very clear.
Hitting her head on a cliff and losing consciousness was an afterimage of her memories.
“huh?”
Shirone, who came to his senses, finally sensed the hot energy flowing into his lips.
An unknown woman was sitting on top of him and kissing him.
Shirone, whose face flushed, pushed her away in surprise.
“What, what?”
The woman rolled onto her side helplessly, exhaling painfully with her naked body exposed.
Shirone hurriedly lit the lights with her Shining magic.
“Peope?”
The reason why she couldn’t believe it even though she said it herself was because she, a little fairy, was as big as an adult woman’s body.
However, the little dress she was wearing was torn to pieces, and the fairy wings that fell beside her proved that she was Feofe.
“Shirone… … .”
Feope struggled to open her eyes and smiled brightly.
After reading the emotion in that smile, Shirone rolled her eyes in confusion.
why is she here? No, what the hell is this mogol?
“What happened, Peope?”
“I’m glad you’re safe.”
Only then did Shirone examine her body.
All wounds were completely healed.
It was impossible to recover from a fatal wound in such a short period of time when the Diamond Armament was released.
There was no doubt that she had saved herself.
“why? I want you… … .”
Feope shook her head.
It didn’t matter to her what Shirone was thinking.
The most important thing at the end of life is something so trivial that even Peope is surprised.
“Shirone, how are you?”
Shirone didn’t know what that meant. After thinking for a while, he looked at her body.
The price of exploding all lives at once is rapid growth. And it was the loss of the fairy due to mental breakdown.
“Am I pretty?”
Feope’s question was so innocent that Shirone could not say anything.
I got goosebumps when I realized that I had nothing to give back except my feelings of gratitude.
But it is true.
It was impossible to create something without substance.
When there was no answer from Shirone, Feope quickly closed her eyes.
I felt sad but happy. There won’t be any regrets left in the end.
“Don’t look, Shirone.”
Peope gave her last wish.
“please… … don’t look.”
Feope’s body began to shrink rapidly. It was the aftermath of a storm that burned all life.
“Pe, Peope… … .”
Shirone watched Peope’s transformation in a state of fascination.
Feope’s face, which had shrunk to the size of a fairy, was full of wrinkles, and all the muscles in her firm body had been lost, leaving only bony bones.
Beside her were wings of the right size at last, but those that had already fallen off were just running towards decay, losing their vitality.
“Peope! Peope!”
Shirone put Feope in her hand and shouted.
At the end of her lifespan, her body did not even move.
You shouldn’t die like this.
Shirone, who finally realized in front of her corpse, held Feope in front of her eyes.
He was barely breathing.
‘I’m still alive.’
But how can I save her?
“There is nowhere to run anymore, foolish human.”
When the voice of the fairy Mirka resonated outside the cave, Shirone grabbed Armand with one hand and stood up.
Beyond the curtain of light outside the cave, Mirka and other fairy troops were completely blocking the exit.
Shirone held Peope in her hand without showing any fear and moved forward slowly.
It wasn’t until they came out that they realized why the fairy troops had quietly retreated.
Indeed, an enormous army completely dominated the four directions.
There is no way to escape.
Having concluded that, Mirka looked at Feope lying in Shirone’s hand with sad eyes.
“A foolish thing. That’s how I explained what the cost of liking humans is.”
It is not that there was not a single fairy in history who loved a human.
But with that said, it was always miserable.
Fairies are pure and humans are selfish.
No matter how hot it burns, human greed is endless, and in the end, it is to dry up the fairy after endlessly craving it.
“I am still alive. How can I get Peope back?”
This was the reason why Shirone entered the siege smoothly.
“Human, accept the aura obediently. If so, I will take responsibility for Feope’s life and save it.”
“You asked what the method was.”
Seeing Shirone’s unbending eyes, Mirka replied in a cold voice.
“There is only one person in heaven who can restore a fairy whose lifespan is over. Archangel Ichael.”
The moment Shirone heard it, he instinctively sensed that it was the truth.
Literally the incarnation of amplification.
If it was Ikael, he would be able to amplify Feope’s feeble emotion and restore it to its original state.
“okay.”
“It is a good choice. Hand over Peope to us… … .”
“Geumgang Armed Forces.”
Shirone grabbed Armand’s handle and activated the Diamond Armament.
In an instant, organic robes wrapped around him and floated overhead, with cybernetic eyes and Akamai’s eyes attached.
The fairies were all nervous and prepared for battle.
Although he was defeated by Mirka, he was a skilled man who shot down countless fairies.
However, Mirka, who already knew that there was no variable in her match against Shirone, raised the corner of her mouth mockingly.
“You have a good weapon. Thanks to that, he must have been able to play an active role up to this point with his level of skill. But you, who have taken off that weapon, are nothing more than a weak human being.”
Since I’ve already overpowered the incarnation’s strength, it doesn’t matter what skills the opponent uses or how many different skills they have.
The lack of variables was the scariest thing about the razor of truth.
Shirone put Feope in Armand’s robe without replying.
A pouch was made near the heart and secured with Ringer’s minerals.
If you want to get to Ikael as quickly as possible, you will have to go through a fierce battle.
Realizing that Shirone had no intention of surrendering, Mirka held out her hand with an angry face.
“Kill it. Let them pay for the sin of scorning heaven.”
The fairies waiting everywhere flew towards Shirone at terrifying speed.
At the same time, Shirone’s eyes slanted forward.
Magic of unknown properties rained down from all sides, and the fairies were moving quickly as if swaying in a storm, but Shirone ignored them all.
How to see everything when you see nothing.
As Shirone’s Jikji was activated, the boundaries of the Spirit Zone gradually began to blur.
Mirka, the highest-ranking being of justice, was the first to sense the change.
“That… … ?”
Spirit Zone’s presence is gradually fading. Eventually, as he completely melted into the world, the boundaries disappeared.
Kwak Kwah Kwah Kwah Kwah!
When Shirone opened her eyes, dozens of photon cannons were pierced in a diagonal line from a completely distant place.
It was an angle that would have been impossible without Shirone shooting in the air.
The fairies rushing from the side were exposed defenseless to the unexpected pattern of attacks, and were swept to the ground by a waterfall of flashes.
“what? how to magic… … !”
Shirone made a photon cannon and fired it from all directions.
The riot of flashes entangled like a net and bombarded the fairies indiscriminately.
Even in the midst of that, the fairies could not find the starting point of the magic and only looked around with a bewildered expression.
There is no central point where magic is implemented.
Shirone’s mind assimilated with the world achieved a state of perfect omnipotence, and the bundled photon cannons rapidly turned and swept away the enemies like a school of anchovies swimming in the sea.
“Keuuugh!”
Mirka hurriedly escaped from the radius.
It was shocking that the first unit that tried to subdue Shirone was completely wiped out, but the first thing that came to her mind was an ancient record.
“This is Gaia… … .”
The spirit zone of those who use the Ultima system, ‘Elysion’, has been resurrected beyond the ages.

Chapter - 482 - Jikji (4).txt
===============================
[482] Jikji (4)
“He’s a human anyway!”
Mirka denied that Shirone’s Spirit Zone was Elysion.
Gaia, a mythical human being feared by Ankera and driven Heaven to the brink of destruction.
But didn’t they eventually lose the war and leave the world?
It didn’t make sense that their powers, for which no evidence could be found other than fragmentary records, suddenly revived at this moment.
“Do you think a human can use Elysion? You’re doing a clumsy mimic.”
As if to refute Mirka’s words, Shirone opened her eyes and cast a photon cannon.
At the flash of light that came out of nowhere, she threw herself away, not being able to dare to cast out the prescribed meal.
‘It’s definitely dangerous.’
If Immortal Function is infinite, Elysion is intangible.
The mind, completely integrated with the outside world, treats all information detected by the Ultima System as if it were its own.
Similar to the combination of the spirit zone and ancient magic used by Shirone, Mirka was fighting a system rather than a specific individual named Shirone.
Jikji of the Ultima system was a very unfamiliar phenomenon to all beings with individuality.
The completely different combat system threw the fairies into confusion, and Shirone’s magic, which had adapted to Elysion, began to devastate everywhere with more powerful destructive power.
‘I have to stop here.’
After watching the 7 fairies disappear in just 10 seconds, Mirka finally made up her mind.
Whether Shirone used Elysion or imitated it, the ability itself was real anyway.
“Everyone follow me!”
As Mirka took the lead and flew, Shirone also fired a photon cannon from behind, sending flashes of light as if she were swinging multiple blows with both fists.
At the same time, Mirka’s razor blade of truth outside the rules was activated.
A ghastly white glow shimmered around her, and a mass-laden photon struck her body.
Kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa!
All the fairies who knew the ability to eat out of the rules stopped fighting for a while and watched the results.
Shirone also looked at Mirka with fierce eyes.
“Whoop, whoop whoop.”
Mirka, who was in good condition, was smiling with her hand out.
Even among fairies, she belonged to the highest level, so she still had the upper hand in the power of incarnation.
However, she couldn’t help but be nervous, her smile was severely stiff.
“I won.”
In any case, it is invincible against Shirone as long as the Elimination Rules are activated.
Having invoked another rule of obedience, she began to rush in with great speed.
“Sheesh!”
Shirone spread her wings wide and soared into the sky.
As all the fairies soared vertically, they left the Valley of Whales in an instant and rushed into the sky.
“Catch it! If we just hold on, it is our victory.”
In Syrone’s field of vision, countless magics from fairies rained down on her.
There were various types depending on the concept of birth of the visible, invisible, material, phenomenal, and fairies, but Shirone did not hold any attachments to any of them and just looked straight ahead.
Elysion integrated and delivered all the information in one dimension, and Armand’s powerful function greatly increased Shirone’s reflexes.
“Unbelievable… … .”
Even the fairies born with the ability to fly were basically surprised by Shirone’s movement, which evaded a large number of bullets that seemed to have no blind spots.
Shirone, who escaped from the magic net that could never be escaped without calculating the error in millimeters, started a counterattack.
As soon as Akamai’s eyes caught the target, photon cannons flew in from all directions and concentrated damage.
Whenever Antithese’s focus quickly jumped between fairies, the fairies crashed without a doubt.
“What are you doing!”
As Mirka flew in with a roar of rage, Shirone also stopped attacking and kept an eye on her.
‘Let’s stay calm. I’m thinking.’
Shirone knew that Mirka was invincible, but unlike before, she did not fall into despair.
All out-of-regulation events are accompanied by triggering conditions and costs.
‘I just can’t become invincible enough to block the first attack.’
The first thing that comes to mind is time constraints.
You won’t be able to remain invincible forever. But that alone isn’t enough.
It was rather easy for Shirone to make a judgment because the advantage was so strong.
‘Spatial constraints.’
Having come to a conclusion, Shirone sharply turned the angle to avoid the rushing Mirka.
After confirming Mirka’s reaction as she tried her best to follow Shirone with her eyes, he was certain.
‘I see. in sight… … .’
It disturbed Mirka with a dazzling movement that raised the function of the optical wing to the maximum.
“joy! Good idea, but… … .”
Until now, the enemies who tried to break the razor of truth were numerous.
However, it was just an illusion that focused only on the ability to eliminate variables.
If you think about it a little differently, you can understand why Mirka got this ability.
Ranked third among countless fairies.
Mirka was originally a strong fairy, and eating out was just a tool used to maintain her strength 100%.
“You dare to bully me?”
Mirka’s body turned into light and chased after Shirone.
She rushed at a terrifying speed, and accelerated with the thought of piercing Shirone’s body, which was caught in the law of obedience.
pop! As the sound exploded, Mirka passed through Shirone and her eyes were filled with shock.
“what?”
Shirone suddenly disappeared.
It wasn’t the movement of the coordinates, it was literally disappearing.
Mirka hurriedly looked around at the sound of the wind blowing. Shirone’s tentacles were approaching at high speed.
As long as it is out of sight, the regular eating out is reset.
Knowing this, Mirka hurriedly threw her upper body back.
Keugh! The wind pressure alone pushed her body several meters.
Shirone did not stop at swinging her tentacles, but connected them and fired photon cannons.
Even as she turned into light and drew a complicated trajectory while avoiding it, Mirka’s mind kept asking questions.
How did you get out of sight?
“The razor of truth!”
After regaining her composure to some extent, she started eating out again.
The photon cannon vanished in vain, and realizing that she was invincible again, she glared at Shirone.
Valhalla action.
The moment he saw the magic circle of fallen angels behind Shirone, everything became clear.
‘Oops… … !’
Reversal of cause and effect.
If time was reversed after reaching certain coordinates, she would not be able to keep Shirone in sight.
‘With this, I can avoid eating out. But I have to refrain from making big attacks.’
However, Shirone also had a restriction of action delay in return for reversing causality.
Mirka must be attacked at least once to activate Eating Out of the Rules, and Shirone will also be bitten if she miscalculates the delay.
A situation where we have no choice but to look out for each other.
However, with this, it could be said that the formidable strength of eating out was destroyed and the balance of power was balanced.
Shirone struggled amidst the group of fairy troops.
It was a one-on-one battle, but the victory was gradually leaning towards Shirone.
The magic from Elysion’s intangibles didn’t even give them time to adapt, and steadily defeated the enemies, and finally, the lethal laser network was unfolded.
Because there was no central point, the net of red lines, which was possible, stretched out in all directions, obstructing the movements of the fairies.
Screams echoed through the sky as the Homing Photon Cannon slipped between the nets and exploded enemies.
“You insignificant human!”
As soon as Mirka casts the Razor of Truth, the Valhalla action is activated, and Shirone disappears.
‘I have to find it!’
Mirka looked around until her head broke.
If he could find it before Shirone’s delay ended, it would be his victory.
‘huh?’
Turning her back, her eyes widened in shock. Contrary to expectations, Shirone came close to her.
The figure of spinning and swinging its tentacles was domineering, but it wasn’t to the extent that it couldn’t be avoided with Mirka’s skills.
‘Stupid human. Did I throw an irrational number out of nervousness?’
Mirka laughed and held out her hand.
Shirone is completely defenseless as long as you block it by eating out.
“Ouch!”
However, right before she could activate her ability, Mirka shuddered as she felt a strong binding force.
From the side, Akamai’s pupils, which were embedded in addition to the cybernetic brain, were aimed at him.
The advantage of Valhalla Action is that it can reverse the cause and effect of all linked events.
In other words, the two results of leaving Mirka floating on the side and then going back to her rear and attacking were accelerated at the same time.
The delay is long, but it was Shirone’s own variable created to break the tight balance of power.
‘Is there no absolute result?’
When the thought reached that point, a thump rang in Mirka’s head.
With her head broken, she flew toward the distant sky, and as soon as her inertia ended, she fell down in a parabola.
“Mr. Mirka!”
All the fairies floating in the sky couldn’t believe the sight unfolding before their eyes.
Of the 72 classes of fairies, the noble spiritual body belonging to the 2nd class was destroyed by only humans.
All the fairies rushed as the rage of the tribal pride was trampled on.
“Huh!”
Shirone frowned and waited for the delay to dissipate.
Because the two events were reversed, the waiting time was much longer than usual.
When the delay was finally lifted, countless magics were already rushing toward him.
‘I have no choice but to do it.’
It was never a way that suited my inclination, but now it is an exhibition situation. Violence is sometimes necessary to win.
Shirone used Elysion’s mental power to cast one of her organs, Berserk.
However, that wide width was a completely different temperament from what he had shown so far.
Literally, multiple explosions in a wide range.
Due to the nature of Elysion without a central point, wide explosions erupted in numerous places.
If it was the existing light width that simply stopped at bouncing something, this time it was a way to crush it with a curtain of light from all directions.
Kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwak!
“Quaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
All the fairies trapped in Elysion’s sphere of influence let out a terrifying scream.
A cracking sound could be heard from the small body caught between the curtain and the gap between the curtains.
When viewed from a distance, it was a sight as if a thunderbolt struck out of nowhere in a clear sky.
As the spheres of light with a diameter of 30 meters flashed, the fairies shuddered and fell as if they had been electrocuted.
When the casting of the wide range, which can only be performed in Elysion, ended, the sky became blue and calm again.
The fairy troops were annihilated, and Shirone, who was floating alone in the air, looked up at the higher sky and took a deep breath.
The light wing suddenly disappeared and his body fell as it stood.
While accelerating toward the ground at a terrifying speed, Armand’s robes stretched out and flew dozens of meters before rooting on the ground.
At the same time, while canceling the power, Shirone’s body landed lightly as if it had jumped from a low place.
It was halfway up the mountain, and below the mountain range, I could see the paradise where the subjects resided.
“ha.”
Shirone sat down for a while to soothe her weary spirit.
Armand’s nerves vividly conveyed the comfort of Peope in his arms.
How strong have you become? Shirone thought for a moment.
But what I felt right now was only the horror of the spirit and reality that was being devastated through the war.
“I have to go further.”
that is war There were also personal things that had to be done.
“Be patient with me a little longer, Peope.”
As Armand restored some of her bodily functions, Shirone rose again.
As I gently bent my knees, huge wings of light spread out from behind me again.
Perong!
Shirone’s body, which flew up in a cloud of dust, jumped over the mountain range at high speed and flew to Arabot.

Chapter - 483 - Night in Heaven (1) 1.txt
===============================
[483] Night in Heaven (1)
In the basement of the Hall of Fall in the Second Heaven Rakia, there was a torture chamber where angels who had lost their divinity from whales were imprisoned and tortured.
If you look at angels by the standard of the physical world, their durability is strong enough to transcend human beings, so the instruments of torture are also full of bizarre things on a scale that cannot be seen in the human world.
Kang Nan passed out, relying solely on the chain handcuffs coming down from the ceiling, with both hands tied.
Unknown snakes crawled across the floor, and the confined air was repulsive enough to mask even the smell of brimstone from burning torches.
Dozens of eyes widened in the darkness and Mara appeared.
Torco, the servant of the fallen angel Mauriel.
It was a single mara with a skinny old face, a bald head, a belly that protruded like a tadpole, and legs much shorter than long arms.
Called the God of Screams in some worlds, he has a perfect understanding of the human body and is an excellent torturer who causes pain with his delicate fingertips.
Muddy laughter could be heard from the walls on all sides.
“Chig gigg kik, let me hear the screams, the disgusting human screams.”
“Can I not kill you? If you spend 1/43 of your hatred towards Maze, you will die.”
The fallen angels, who demanded an exchange of labyrinths and hardships throughout Rakia, gave their subordinates a chance to relieve their anger.
Some maras are not at all interested in human suffering, but on the other hand, there are maras who are extremely interested, and everyone gathered in the torture chamber is of that type.
Torco put his palms together and slapped Gangnan on the cheek.
An echo that was completely different from the usual sound spread, and the shock tore through Gangnan’s brain.
“Huhhhhh!”
Kang Nan frowned at the feeling of his skull splitting and regained consciousness.
“Here… … .”
All I can see is an old man with a hooked nose.
But her senses sensed the many evil energies permeating the prison walls.
‘They’re caught.’
It was what I was promising. Rather, it was only lamentable that in that situation he did not die right away and lost consciousness.
As I pulled the handcuffs on my wrists, the chain connected to the ceiling slid.
Only iron can get out.
‘Cause if you break your wrist
‘The handcuffs are absorbing power.’
As far as she knows, it is impossible to block the schema in the normal way.
Then there are two things I can think of.
Out-of-regulation or… … .
“Is it an object?”
“Objet <Jachung>. The stronger you give it, the stronger it becomes. You won’t be able to get out.”
‘Annoying… … .’
To paraphrase Mara’s words, as strength is removed, rigidity weakens.
However, if the minimum stiffness was stronger than the human body, it was impossible for Gangnan to escape.
“Kill him.”
It was better to give up quickly on strategies that didn’t work.
“In the end you will die. But maybe I can live.”
When Kang Nan looked at him, Torco smiled as if curious about her reaction.
“If the humans bring Maze back by noon tomorrow.”
When hope arises, man becomes ugly.
I already shuddered at the thought of how messy this fearless female warrior would become after jumping over the drawbridge and reclaiming the maze.
“pooh!”
Torco’s face hardened.
Kang Nan, who burst out laughing with his lungs moving, gave a pitiful look.
“The labyrinth never comes.”
can’t come
There was no way Gaold would exchange the result of giving his all for 20 years with his own life.
‘Yes, I’m not coming.’
If he had been that indecisive, he wouldn’t have pushed himself to death in the first place.
‘I wish. Meet the person you love.’
Contrary to expectations, Torco’s face twisted as Gangnan smiled.
“If you don’t bring Maze, all you have left is death at the end of the scream. How are you going to scream? How can I beg you to kill me?”
Mara’s voice echoed ominously in the dark.
“Kikiki, human screams are the best music in the world.”
Born as a warrior, die as a warrior.
Even in the face of terrifying threats, Ram Muay’s warriors did not waver.
-Kangnan, you are a woman.
I first met Gaold sixteen years ago, when she was thirteen.
Her life after leaving the south was a series of trials, just as the wolf tribe was exterminated and ran away.
Everyone who reached out to the child who had nothing had an ulterior motive, most likely because she was a woman.
Gangnan had an excellent body among the wolf tribe, but was too young to defeat the world’s strongest.
Eventually, it was the point at which he was kidnapped by bandits and taken to the slave market in a foreign country.
“Don’t stare at me like that.”
The man who was facing Gangnan in the luggage compartment said.
“I don’t think you were human from the start. Like dogs and horses, pigs and cats. Depending on what kind of animal you become, you may have a decent life. Because you are pretty and rare.”
“I am a wolf.”
The man could not understand the language of the south.
But he knew he couldn’t get a high price without getting the poison out of her eyes.
The tastes of those who buy slaves vary greatly, but it was easy for the value to plummet if you tried to cater to the tastes of a few.
“I can’t. I’ll have to quench it beforehand.”
Darkness fell as the man pitched the tent in the luggage compartment.
And when he looked back, the man’s eyes were not normal, unlike a moment ago.
thump.
A sound like chewing cartilage burst from his knuckles.
“First, shall we become a dog?”
“I am a wolf.”
Gangnan sighed and knelt down.
Jumping out with all her might, with her hands tied behind her back, she hit the man’s abdomen with her head, pushing further and jumping out of the carriage.
“crazy!”
Jumping off a moving wagon with your hands tied was tantamount to suicide.
A heavy wheel was pushed toward Gangnan’s face as he fell to the floor.
Just when you thought it was too late to dodge, the wheels splintered and the wagon overturned.
Kang Nan knelt down and looked to the side.
But before she could examine anything, the thieves came running and started beating her up.
“Damn it! Kill them!”
Kang Nan, whose hands were tied behind his back, was beaten defenselessly.
However, she stood up thinking of her whole body as a shield, and showed off Ram Muay’s skills with her free two feet.
With her short stature, she was dodging among the bandits, but when a large man stood in front of her, she swung her leg.
The moment the low kick hit the shin as thick as a log, there was a hard, dull impact sound.
“Aaaaaaa!”
The huge man couldn’t stand the pain and fell to the ground screaming.
It was not the brilliance of a thirteen-year-old child.
“Don’t belittle me. I’m from the wolf tribe… … .”
However, that was all she could achieve, and she had to roll to the floor again after punches flying from all directions.
“ah! it’s annoying!”
A man who had been pushed by Kang Nan and fell from the carriage approached with blood on his head.
He took a dagger out of his boot and raised his arm as he glared at Kang Nan.
“I will stab you a hundred times and kill you!”
Then again, there was a loud bang and the man’s head exploded.
“what?”
Only then did the thieves realize that it was no mere accident.
A man was walking at the end of the forest road they had been running on.
It was a twenty-four-year-old Gaold who had graduated from Alpheas Magic School and had gone on to seek training.
Unlike his current appearance, he still had a youthful spirit, his body was so skinny that only bones remained, and his complexion was dark as if he would soon die.
However, the most deeply engraved impression of Kang Nan was the two eyes that seemed to contain death.
“What are you? Are you a wizard?”
“… … Have you ever seen God?”
The thieves, who would get hives just by hearing the name Shin, met each other’s eyes and giggled.
“Are you a crazy monk?”
It was not uncommon to meet people who had lost their minds at the end of the search while wandering the world doing human trafficking.
“Have you really never seen it? Where the hell is God?”
The leader of the bandits swung a dagger and stepped forward.
“Hey, what are you doing in search of God? Have you committed any crime?”
“I… … .”
Before Gaold could finish his sentence, the dagger flew between his eyes.
“Because I have to kill you.”
Puff puff puff puff!
As the air compressed, the heads of all the bandits standing around the fallen wagon exploded.
Gaold, who lightly bent his head to avoid the dagger, moved slowly.
Then, he looked down at Kang Nan, who was staring up at him in a state of fascination, and said,
“Little boy, have you ever seen God?”
Kang Nan shook his head slowly even as fear of a temperament he had never felt before surrounded his body.
“Where are you? Where are you? I have to kill you.”
The sight of Gaold looking around the forest for something was the height of bizarreness to Kang Nan.
‘Crazy. This man is crazy.’
After looking around for a long time, Gaold looked down at the river again and untied the rope tied to his hand.
‘I have to run away.’
That was the first thought that came to Gangnan’s mind.
However, before he could put it into action, Gaold’s hand suddenly reached out.
“Can it happen? Judging by her appearance, she looks like a southerner. Where is your tribe?”
Kang Nan forgot all his fears and glared fiercely at Gaold.
So far, among the people who have extended their hands in favor, not one has benefited them.
“I am a wolf.”
Gaold’s eyes were half-closed as he stared at Gangnan’s burning face.
“It was a wolf tribe. I heard you’re devastated It must have been hard.”
‘Do you know Nambang language?’
It was surprising that the madman, so disfigured that the beggar would cry, understood what he was saying.
“What is your name?”
After thinking about who this man was, Kang Nan slowly opened his mouth.
“Strong. Aho, gangnan.”
“Gangnan?”
Gaold searched for the meaning of the memory, which had become more blurred lately.
“The spirit of the wolf.”
Then, gently raising the corner of his mouth, he said.
“What a wonderful name, Gangnan.”
Kang Nan will never forget the emotions he felt at that moment.
“let’s go. I’m hurt a lot. It needs to be treated.”
Gangnan followed Gaold to a cave in the woods.
He was still full of vigilance, but it was at the point where he needed someone’s help.
Gaold handed him dry bread from his bag.
It was hard as a stone, but the amount was large enough to eat for several days.
I was very hungry, so I ate it, but I couldn’t break it in the jaws of a child without melting it with saliva.
Gaold was chewing on those things well.
The only curious thing was the moaning sound leaking from the depths of his throat whenever he moved his jaw.
As expected, thinking that he was crazy, Kang Nan said as if declaring war.
“I will leave tomorrow morning.”
Gaold nodded without stopping.
That night.
“Huh. Whoa.”
Gaold opened his eyes to the faint groaning that leaked out of the river.
“what’s the matter? Where are you sick?”
“nothing… … no.”
Gaold sat down and noticed Gangnan’s pale face covered in cold sweat.
“Speak. what’s the problem?”
“Nothing… … !”
When Gangnan gritted his teeth and became stubborn, Gaold didn’t care anymore and lay down.
“tight. I’ll be leaving in the morning.”
As time passed and around midnight, Jiang Nan crawled out of the cave and stumbled into the forest.
And after a while, Gaold’s eyes flashed open.
—————————————

[484] Heaven’s Night (2)
When Gaold came out of the cave, Gangnan was nowhere to be seen, but the footprints on the floor were heading towards the forest.
Gangnan’s face was severely crumpled as he searched for the most secluded place in the forest.
Suppressing the moans that escaped from her pursed lips, she stomped her feet and looked around.
Eventually, he couldn’t stand it and jumped into the bush and sat down as soon as he lowered his pants.
Because she had endured going to the bathroom for two days, her bladder felt like it was about to burst.
The pain was greater than the pleasure, and at the end of the tingling pain, the coolness of urinating flooded in, and finally his expression regained a sense of stability.
However, the feeling of lightness was short-lived, and soon her eyes were sharply wary of her son-in-law.
Leaving the South, what the world taught her was that she shouldn’t give excuses in the first place.
More ferociously, like a beast, biting doubt before it turns to certainty.
That was the way the last descendant of the wolf tribe lived in the world.
“How long have you been patient?”
When Gangnan was about to stand up after finishing his errands, he heard Gaold’s voice from the forest.
After a while, the bushes cleared and he appeared in a haggard appearance.
The forest blocked the moonlight, but for some reason, his pupils seemed to radiate their own light.
As Kang Nan’s nose wrinkled, his spirit rose.
It is clear that this man, like the others, had a dark heart.
The only difference is that he is an expert who can’t even feel the presence.
“If you hold on too long, you will get sick. Did the men do anything bad to you?”
A cold smile crept across Kang’s lips.
It was because there was not a single man who really cared about himself for anyone who asked such a thing.
“I am a wolf. If you treat me as a human being, I will kill you.”
“Kangnan, you are a woman.”
Gaold moved on.
As if floating on the ground, with a calm gait, Kang Nan hesitated and stepped back.
“And I am a man.”
Kang Nan backed away without thinking back and put his back on the trunk of the tree.
Before I knew it, Gaold was right in front of me.
“Anything can happen.”
The moment the madman’s eyes cooled down, Kang Nan realized that it would be the end if he stayed as it was, and launched an attack.
Gaold’s legs popped as she landed her most confident low kick.
‘what?’
It’s like hitting an airbag full of air.
There was no shock whatsoever.
“omg!”
Gaold’s hand pressed down on Gangnan’s shoulder.
Helpless, she sat down and fell to the floor at Gaold’s hand.
Gaold sat down on her stomach and put his hands on her shoulders.
“Hey, let go of this! Otherwise… … .”
“Don’t run away from you.”
Gangnan’s mouth was closed.
“Woman or man, don’t worry about things that have already been decided. What really matters is what you can do.”
When Gaold pushed his face in, Kang Nan shuddered.
It was an inescapable fear.
“Now, tell me. What can you do at this moment?”
I can not do anything.
Her body was completely restrained, and Gaold’s abilities surpassed those of anyone she had ever met.
‘I can’t win by running away.’
He wasn’t as strong as Gaold, but his strength was clever, and Gaold’s words quickly penetrated his mind.
“Hey, haven’t I pulled up my pants yet?”
The moment Gaold was about to check, Kang Nan clenched his teeth and hit him head-on.
With a loud bang, Gaold’s body fell backwards.
“Aaaaaaaaa!”
Kang Nan stood up with a sneer as if he was delighted.
“Hey, how are you? If this… … .”
However, Gaold’s condition was not serious.
Of course, I did my best to headbutt him, but if it was normal, I would faint from shock, but it didn’t hurt that much.
“Aww! Aaaaaaa!”
Gaold was rolling on the ground holding his head.
He was much more sensitive to pain than normal people, and he felt the pain as if his brain were being stirred with an iron rod.
When Gaold’s screams didn’t stop, Kang Nan realized that the situation was serious and ran to him.
“what’s the matter? What happened?”
“Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaa!”
“Say something! Where are you sick?”
No matter how much Gangnan shouted, Gaold couldn’t hear it.
Gaold had to spend the dawn only in pain, and that was the beginning of a long relationship between the two.
As they roamed the world together to practice, Jiangnan learned little by little about Gaold.
He wasn’t the kind of person who liked to talk, but from the occasional combination of words that popped out, you could guess what kind of life he lived.
He was practicing to meet someone.
Adrias Miro.
When he heard that this world was being protected by a woman, he couldn’t help but respect Gangnan too.
“So Miro is the strongest woman in the world?”
“There is no concept of being the best in combat. But officially it will. Miro represented her humanity, and it’s a situation where no one can defeat her.”
Gangnan spat out indifferently and looked at Gaold’s back as he walked away.
the strongest woman in the world.
Is that man in love with such a person?
“How would you feel if I became the strongest in the world?”
Gaold turned his attention to the bold words of the girl who was still only around her waist.
“If you really want to, you might be able to reach it. But in my opinion, it’s probably impossible.”
“why? I’m not afraid of anything I will do anything to become stronger.”
Gangnan’s tenacity was acknowledged by Gaold.
He was also gifted with physical talent as a fighter.
If she grows up like this, her body will surely become a weapon.
However, Gaold also had feelings while wandering around the world, so he had no intention of adding unnecessary wind.
“It’s not a matter of talent. It is not a matter of effort.”
“Then what kind of person is Miro?”
“she is… … .”
Gaold looked at the other side of the desert where the ocher-colored wind was blowing.
“Something more than human. It’s just that I don’t have anything to define, so I just call him a human.”
She stopped and savored Gaold’s words, then followed him with a pouting lip.
“Hmph, but I think I will win in the end.”
The place they arrived was the Akkad Desert in the Kingdom of Paras in the Middle East.
Gaold said that he would practice self-denial to overcome pain there.
The desert is a land of death, and in order for the two of them to survive, misery beyond strength was essential.
In the underground cave where they lived, Gaold’s screams resonated every night, and Gangnan searched for food day and night to sustain the pain.
A madman and a wolf, reclusive in the depths of the desert, lived only by relying on each other’s warmth.
Gangnan still cannot define the relationship at that time.
family? friend? comrades? lover? or enemy.
The two people only sought each other for the feelings that ordinary humans have to experience with many people.
I couldn’t live otherwise.
Then one day, Kang Nan experiences the most terrible tragedy in the world.
“Ugh, tired.”
Taking a bundle of desert bugs in her sack, she wearily walked deep into the cave.
Then I heard Gaold’s tearing screams.
I hear screams every day, but this time, something was different.
It was mixed with anxious sound waves that I was sure of.
“mister!”
As the bundle was untied, the insects that escaped quickly spread radially.
When Kang Nan reached the end of the cave, the screams were no longer heard.
Her eyes, trembling with fear, found Gaold lying on the floor.
“mister! Mister, what’s wrong?”
“Turn it off… … .”
Gaold’s eyes were fixed on the ceiling, and saliva leaked from his mouth.
Knowing the nature of Gaold’s self-reciprocal mutation, she had a hunch.
After continuing to experiment with the threshold of nociception, the brain finally developed an abnormality.
Now he’s in hell.
They were caught in an eternal pain that they did not even know when to get out of.
“mister! Please wake up!”
It was the first time in my life that I felt fear.
Because only the two of them were the whole world, it was impossible to imagine a world without Gaold.
So the fourteen-year-old girl waited for him to return, calling Gaoldman for days and days without doing anything.
Gradually losing consciousness, she fell into Gaold’s arms and fainted. After falling asleep for three days, she slowly opened her eyes.
It was as if he had been asleep for a thousand years.
However, when she checked Gaold, who still showed no sign of waking up, her eyes showed a fierce determination unlike before.
Sasasak.
Sensitive hearing picked up the footsteps of insects crawling on the floor.
Lost in thought for a moment, she quickly reached out and grabbed the insect’s body.
She stuffed a thumb-sized worm into her mouth and chewed it, then kissed Gaold and pumped in the shredded nourishment.
Taking out a pot of drinking water and gently placing the spout of the water bottle to Gaold’s lips, she said in a determined voice, as if she had made up her mind.
“Wait, uncle. I will definitely save you. I will do anything to bring you back.”
Gangnan went out to the city of Paras.
Clinic, medicine, magic, information.
No matter what you get, what you need is money.
Does Gaold know?
What kind of life Gangnan had to live during the one year that it took for him to wake up again.
What kind of hardships he had to go through to keep an adult who was like a vegetable man incapable of doing anything.
However, Kang Nan had never mentioned what had happened at the time.
It was the time I endured while waiting for Gaold to wake up.
And when Gaold finally opened his eyes miraculously, the anger and resentment that had built up in his heart disappeared without a trace.
“Whoa.”
The first sight that came to Gaold’s eyes after he came to his senses was not the shady cave he fell into hell, but the ceiling of a simple inn.
After waiting for a while, the door clicked open.
After returning with food and medicine, Kang Nan was shocked to see Gaold lying on the bed and blinking.
“mister… … .”
Kang Nan, who threw the bag of food, jumped into Gaold’s arms and burst into tears.
“mister! mister!”
Kang Nan was 15 years old at the time.
Although only a year had passed, Gaold was unfamiliar with how Kang Nan had grown physically and mentally.
“You saved me.”
Kang Nan shook his head and wiped away tears.
he is back You won’t be alone again.
“Don’t do that again. Promise. Never leave me.”
Gaold stared at Gangnan’s face.
Because I know why you don’t ask.
Because I know the hellish time Gangnan had to fight alone to protect himself.
Gaold hugged Gangnan’s face.
“Let’s go back to Tormia. I will never leave you again.”
Gaold’s self-denial after escaping from hell was on a different level than before.
Now was the time to start in earnest.
He returns to Tormia and becomes the head of the Magic Association.
Without that much, the maze could not be recaptured, and Gangnan will play a key role in the project as his second-in-command.
Kang Nan nodded in Gaold’s arms.
The sadness I had to go through so far did not stop the tears, but it was something that Gaold couldn’t find out.
“Mister, there is one thing I have decided this time.”
When Gangnan raised his head as if he had suddenly remembered, Gaold also smiled and asked.
“Yeah, what is it?”
Kang Nan said with a bright smile.
“I will become the second strongest woman in the world.”

Chapter - 485 - Night in Heaven (3) 3.txt
===============================
[485] Heaven’s Night (3) “What are you thinking?” The basement of the Hall of Corruption in Rakia. Kang Nan, who escaped from the flashback, raised his eyes. The fallen angel Mauriel’s subordinate, Mara Torco, was looking at him with a smile that seemed like it would smell disgusting. “Are you ready for the terrible torture that is about to happen? But blocking thoughts won’t help at all.” When Torco pulled Gangnan by the collar, there was a clicking sound and his clothes tore off. “We are all slaves to time. If you spread your time by length, you have exactly 18 hours left. It is a time where only pain and extinction await.” Torco wanted to remind him of the reality, but time had already stopped flowing in Gangnan’s mind. “Gaold is not coming.” This is the end. So whatever future awaits, it’s already over. “Cheuk, then all you have left is a desperate scream.” When Kang Nan responded with a laugh until the end, the expression on Torco’s face finally disappeared. “I got some fun stuff for the first time in a while.” Slowly backing away, Torco held out both hands, and his weapon, a two-pronged whip, was gripped in both hands. “First of all, I’ll have to mince the meat.” As soon as he finished speaking, Torco’s hands swung alternately. Every time the whip struck, Gangnan felt pain as if his skin was burning. ‘sick.’ The pain traveled through the nerves to the brain, sublimated into new mental pain, and spread. ‘sick.’ What you feel at the end of the pain is a more vague feeling. ‘It must always have been this painful.’ Even breathing was like inhaling glass powder, and even taking a step felt like walking on a nail. However, Gaold endured everything and came this far. Therefore, you can be patient with yourself. ‘I won’t scream.’ Every time the harsh whip hit him on the cheek, the time he spent with Gaold flashed in Gangnan’s mind like a thunderbolt. * * * “The sun is setting.” Sain confirmed that it was getting dark outside the forest and approached Gaold. His eyes, still gnawing at his thumb, were brutal enough to kill anyone who approached him, but even as a worldly citizen, he could not yield any more. “Make up your mind, Gaold. What are you going to do?” Gaold’s self-injury stopped with a snap of his teeth. No one here knows what Gangnan means to him. Couldn’t you have known? What I realized now is that Gaold himself had completely forgotten what she had given him. maze only. I had poured all my passion into turning the stopped clock, so I never had time to think about who was following me. ‘It’s pitiful.’ Miro was sitting on a rock with her chin resting on her face and her legs crossed. Her left leg draped over her knee swayed and swayed, representing her dissatisfaction. When the owner’s planting was not good, Arius crawled to her and received the wobbly foot as his head. With a whimper, he brushed the dirt off her bare feet with a ball, then put her toe in his mouth and began to suck on it. If Arius is a human, Miro is a god. If Miro is a human, then Arius is something less than human. Since its relative status does not change, Miro left it alone. Then, as if annoyed, he removed his toe from his mouth and kicked Arius in the face. “Beep! Knock!” Whether or not Arius rolled on the floor with a sad expression on his face, Miro stood up and strode toward Gaold. “hey! make sure! Is it me or is it that girl? I’m so annoyed I won’t be able to see you!” A huge map of heaven and humanity is being drawn in Miro’s mind, but if you look down at it from a slightly more human perspective, it’s only natural that Gaold’s indecisiveness hurts his pride. Of course, even if Gaold chooses him, he has no intention of accepting him. But that’s why it’s even more absurd that he’s lost between the two women. Gaold slowly turned his gaze to look up at the maze. There is no doubt that the woman he wanted so much, who risked his whole life, is in front of him and that he loves the maze. But why is my heart pounding? My heart, which was supposed to run blindly towards the maze, was shaking as if I was running on a dirt road whenever I thought of the river. “I can guess what kind of life you lived.” Seeing Gaold’s reaction, Miro was convinced. “I must have trained in a lot of pain. For 20 years, it must have been the years when I reached this point while only looking at myself.” Gaold just listened. It was overwhelmingly moving that a woman who was more desperate than her life would recognize her hard work, but she finally realized it. The fact that I would never have been able to get this far on my own. “You know that too, right?” Miro recalled the look in Gangnan’s eyes at the last moment. “While you were running looking at me, that child only looked at your back and ran.” Gaold looked away from Maze and looked straight ahead. maybe it’s the first time The moment Kang Nan stood in front of him. “I don’t know what the story is between the two of you… … .” “Goes.” Gaold interrupted Miro and stood up. All eyes were on him, on his lips to be exact. “I’m going to get a mutt.” No one disputed Gaold’s judgment. Because it was his fight from the beginning. However, at first glance, a sad light passed through the expression of Miro, the subject. The price that must be paid to restore Gangnan is Miro’s death. There was nothing to be afraid of because I had already made up my mind, but when Gaold made this decision, for the first time in my life, I felt a strange feeling of jealousy. But those human emotions had permeated the gigantic psyche and disappeared without a trace, and she smiled again with a relieved expression. “Okay then let’s go. If you let me go and get the child back… … .” “no. I am going alone.” Sein frowned and asked. “alone? What are you going to do?” “I told you, get the mutt back.” “But without the labyrinth… … .” Sein stopped talking as if he realized it only then. “You, can’t you?” Gaold intended to put an end to it. A resolution that can be recalled because he accomplished something more impossible than dying. Whatever the outcome, Gaold has no future. “There may be a final war. The maze must not die.” He only yielded everything in front of the giant Gaold’s emotions, and Sain knew that fact better than anyone else. “Heh, do you feel any sense of responsibility for the confusion of mankind caused by you alone?” “no.” Gaold turned his head and showed a mocking laugh. “What do you know, something like that? I’m just going to meet Gangnan. You guys do the rest yourself.” From God to Labyrinth, and now to Gangran. A human who only knew how to run forward, Miro thought, maybe that was Gaold. ‘okay. So I… … .’ Miro, who was watching Gaold leave the forest vaguely, said. “Hey, why don’t you say goodbye after doing this?” Instead of looking back, Gaold removed the branch that was blocking his path. “Let’s come back and do that. I made a reservation once.” Miro burst out laughing, realizing he wasn’t talking about goodbye. It was an ambiguous situation to reverse since she had spoken it herself. “I saw that then. If you come back intact.” “Quack.” Gaold shrugged and disappeared into the woods. ‘You’re getting stronger, Gaold. I’ve gotten really strong.’ Still annoyed with single-mindedness, but he really has reached it. He had become a man who could confidently make eye contact with himself. ‘Hello, Gaold.’ There was no more laughter to be found on Miro’s face as he turned to Sein. “You have to move fast from now on. Depending on whether we can go back or not, the risk that mankind must bear will be different.” Sein said. “What are you going to do? I stopped the explosion with a stop, but among the archangels, there might be someone with the ability to dispel magic.” It was a fact that I realized after seeing the judicial halo of the archangel of destruction, Yuriel. Ikael’s Ataraxia also surpasses common sense, but Ragnarok also possessed an ability with ideality equal to that of Ragnarok. It surrounds the whole body with the concept of destruction and inflicts a physical attack. Since the original concept is unshakable by anything, there was no way to stop Uriel once Ragnarok was activated. Miro said with her chin on. “The one who can break the stop magic must be Rayel, the archangel of light. His halo of justice should be able to achieve the speed of light. When the stop is released, my head is flying.” said Armin. “If you use the speed of light, you won’t be trapped in the time force field. But dispelling the enchantment is another matter. You probably won’t be able to destroy it easily.” Sein asked. “How much do you guess until the magic is dispelled?” “If it’s an archangel’s ability, maybe… … .” Armin was lost in thought before opening his mouth. “It will take about five minutes.” Miro nodded. “That’s enough. From now on, I will try. You guys care about your own strategy.” “What are you going to do?” “Arius.” When Miro called, Arius approached, wagging his hips as if he had a tail. “Stop being stupid. From now on, I grant you language.” Then Arius bent one knee and sat down as if he had never done that. “Arius. I obey the master’s command.” “There must be a door installed in my head. Enter the maternal consciousness once more. Twice won’t be easy.” “It is, but… … I won’t be able to dispel the archangel’s magic circle with my abilities.” “You don’t have to worry about that. I will remove the magic circle.” Miro explained the operation. “Kariel’s magic circle is blocking the cerebral circuit, preventing concentration. So you’re on my nerves Connect my nerves with a route that bypasses the magic circle. As soon as you enter the spirit zone, I infinitely reduce the magic circle with scale magic. The explosion can’t be stopped, but that’s enough to handle it.” This was the fear of scale magic. If the relative size is maximized, the reasoning created by all kinds of intellect is meaningless. It was an excellent decision even in Sein’s opinion. “Can I make it on time? If the stop is released right now, you will die.” “So you have to do it quickly. Once Arius enters consciousness, from there, time in reality is different. 5 minutes. It should be possible.” “Yes, I have no choice but to leave it to you. be careful.” It makes no sense to worry about the world’s labyrinth. “Let’s go, Arius.” Arius, who read the owner’s thoughts, cast flicker magic and moved the maze to an empty place. Sain, who sent Gaold and Miro, thought of a strategy to end the war in earnest. When the primary goal of recapturing the maze was halfway successful, the thought that came to mind was the identity of the sense of incongruity felt before coming to heaven. ‘Even though the war broke out, there is no movement of the angels. How could this be?’ In the 2nd Heaven, it was interrupted by Yuriel and Kariel, but apart from that, only the fallen angels and Maras were visible. Fighting a war, excluding ordinary angels, is like fighting with arms tied in Heaven’s position. ‘Obviously something is happening that we don’t know about. Where are you moving from? is it heaven? Or the human side?’ In any case, the fact that the Pyeongangsa did not move was an opportunity for the rebels. ‘If there is no special contact, Shirone will activate God’s Punishment by noon. He can’t help but take advantage of his current opportunity.’ Whatever the outcome, tomorrow the war is over. —————————————

Chapter - 486 - Night in Heaven (4).txt
===============================
[486] Heaven’s Night (4)
“It is impossible.”
Uriel tilted his head.
He proposed to the Archangel of Light, Rayel, to release the stop magic on Kariel, but the answer was surprisingly refused.
“why? If it’s your ability, you should be able to do enough to reverse the stopped time.”
Rayel’s concept of the source is light.
Manipulating electromagnetic force freely, he was the greatest speed maniac in heaven.
“Should we call it the logic of power?”
Rayel, along with the other three archangels, told the story of the collision with Ikael.
“Ra has banned the activities of the angels, and the archangel Ikael follows the will of Ra. For that reason, I can’t release Kariel.”
If Ikael had made such a judgment, there was only one way for Uriel to choose.
“I will activate the white watch.”
Baek Kyung, the highest executive body in heaven.
As the scenery disappeared and the white space filled in, the archangels revealed themselves one after another.
Of course, Kariel, who was under the stop magic, could not come, and this time, the archangel of extinction, Faiel, also did not attend.
The other archangels did not know that it was because the Archangel Ikael, the highest authority in Heaven, had arrived.
“Uriel, why did you activate the white watch?”
Ikael’s eyes were more authoritative than ever when he convinced the archangel of the 4 great powers with the logic of power.
“Kariel fell under human magic. As it is a wartime situation, I want to borrow Rayel’s strength.”
Ikael thought for a moment before opening his mouth.
“I allow it.”
The eyes of the archangels were simultaneously focused on Ikael.
“Are you okay? Kariel’s rebellion consequently dispersed Heaven’s power. You will have to take responsibility for that.”
“Winning the war comes first.”
The archangels shut up.
The activities of the ordinary angels were banned by Ra, and the resistance of humans was much stronger than expected.
Of course, I still don’t think I’ll lose, but it was a shame to even think that way.
‘Why did the angel named Ra ban the activities?’
It was a fact that even the archangels who dealt with the concept of the source could not know.
“Mirka is dead.”
Methiel, the archangel of union, said.
With her hair as thin as gold threads hanging down from side to side, she displayed an expression of anger that her beautiful face could not produce.
“Shirone, this is the work of the Nephilim.”
When a boy’s name appeared, the eyes on Ikael sharpened again.
Fairy 2nd class Mirka.
The case of her death, which is equivalent to the highest adult in the internal government, quickly spread throughout Heaven, and Shirone became the enemy of many fairies.
“Is it that strong, only the Nephilim?”
Satiel, the archangel of disintegration, said.
Although they resembled Methiel like twins in appearance, they had a violent temperament that anyone could tell them apart.
Sensing her energy, the astral bodies of the archangels all lit up at once.
If this place hadn’t been the white view of the unification of all things, all matter around it would have been disintegrated into particles.
Ikael, having read the archangels’ complaints, said:
“I should have already said that I would take over Shirone.”
Metatron opened his mouth.
“That’s the problem. Why are you obsessed with the Nephilim? Maybe that boy… … .”
As Metatron’s words cut off, silence fell over the White Watch.
Even the archangel, who had nothing to fear in the world, did not dare to speak out.
Metatron’s mouth disappeared.
There was nothing below the nose, as if it had been covered with skin.
There is one case where this is possible.
Anchera.
The archangels just rolled their eyes at the first act of his will.
In fact, the question that Metatron came up with was also the question of all the archangels, but you shouldn’t pay attention now.
‘Alternatively, Ra… … .’
The obliteration of the original concept causes too much change no matter how much the Akashic Records dominate.
That’s why only the mouth was made to disappear, but the will was conveyed that if it went against the planting even a little, it would be erased.
‘Yeah, there’s something. What is my relationship with Shirone?’
Ikael felt Ra’s will as well, but any further interest was poison.
If Ra had already made up his mind before he lost his memory and had Ra reinstated him, following his will at the time was the clearest solution.
“I will kill Shirone.”
Ikael’s declaration weighed down the white whale with a great sense of intimidation.
“As you can see, Ra’s will is firm. The activities of ordinary angels are prohibited. However, archangel level is allowed to protect Arabot. This is my conclusion. I will vote from now on.”
As expected, the results were unanimous.
* * *
The head of Miro, who was sitting cross-legged in a deep cave and closed her eyes, began to glow brightly.
As Archangel Rayel released the stop on Kariel, the 0.1 second remaining until the explosion began to decrease again.
0.09 seconds. 0.08 seconds… … .
And now, in Miro’s mother’s mind, her incarnation and Arius were destroying the magic circle with all their might.
“Connected!”
Arius correctly connected the cerebral nerves in the labyrinth even when he was blind.
It was only possible because he was able to use microscopic space among scale magics.
When the line of light extended and succeeded in bypassing the circuit blocked by Kariel’s magic circle, the magic circle suddenly vibrated as if it would cause an explosion.
The incarnation of Miro bit her lips with a dismayed expression.
‘Is it already too late?’
It was unpredictable because it was not known how far it differed from real time.
Miro activated the Spirit Zone through the circuit that Arius bypassed.
Immediately after casting the scale magic, the magic circle began to shrink at a tremendous speed.
The only thing you can tell when you feel the detonation effect of the magic circle is that you can’t match it in time.
‘no. If it explodes in this state, the damage is too great.’
It’s not like my head would explode because I’ve reduced the scale, but I guess about 15 percent of my brain was damaged, so I couldn’t exert my full strength.
“Arius!”
“yes!”
Arius, who spread both hands and emits light, turned his head and shouted.
At the same time, Miro ran and threw the magic circle, which had become as small as a fingernail, into his mouth.
“eat!”
Since everything here is the spirit of the labyrinth, if an explosion occurs here, the damage goes to the labyrinth.
However, Arius is a foreign substance that entered Miro’s thoughts.
Therefore, the impact is mitigated by putting a foreign material in the foreign material.
“Ouch!”
Arius, who swallowed the magic circle, looked at the laughing maze in amazement.
“Hehe, isn’t it better for your heart to suffer than for my head?”
‘iced coffee.’
Arius wept.
‘beautiful. It’s so lovely.’
pop!
As Arius’s body shuddered, an explosion occurred on the ship.
At the same time, the maze of reality bounced aside as if it had been hit by something in a cross-legged state.
“Ah, it’s the head!”
It was an explosion that came in through shock offset, so his brain was safe, but smoke was rising from Arius’s mouth as he escaped through the door.
“are you okay?”
Arius, who was holding his stomach while sighing, nodded with a pitiful expression.
“Yes, it is fine.”
There can be no personal sorrow for the sacred Miro.
Also, even in the wizard’s judgment, if one of the two had to suffer, it was right for him to suffer.
‘ah… … Mr. Miro.’
Arius, who suddenly realized, lowered his head.
The impression that she cared for his safety made him forget even for a moment the pain of his internal organs being overturned.
“Dear Miro.”
“huh?”
“If I could love you, I would do anything. Give me a chance… … .”
“do you want to die?”
“I’m sorry!”
Feeling the pressure of the absolute, Arius, who came to his senses, hurriedly lowered his head.
Arius, the only human who has reached Miro’s mother’s mind, knows.
What was her trauma that she found in the temple of Dremo.
‘As expected, you… … .’
While Arius was lost in his thoughts, the labyrinth went out of the cave.
The sun was setting and the moon was rising.
‘I can use magic, but the barrier of time and space is broken, so I can’t stop the war alone.’
“What are you going to do next?”
Arius asked with a guilty expression, and Miro looked back with a beautiful smile.
“What should I do? Heaven must be explored.”
It wasn’t a maze to miss an opportunity like this.
* * *
The war, which broke out early in the morning, did not enter a lull until around midnight.
Small-scale local warfare was still taking place in each district of Heaven, but it was not as fierce as during the day.
To summarize the first day’s battle, it is safe to say that it was a one-sided victory for the rebels.
From the 1st thousand to the 6th thousand, the distance of movement of the rebels who broke through the Outer Gate from all sides and advanced to Arabot was such that when Heaven was divided into three concentric circles, they would fit within the second concentric circle.
The rebel command, currently commanded by Crude, was preparing for tomorrow by establishing an advance base in the middle of Matei, the 5th Heaven.
The son-in-law was silent, as if everyone was asleep, but everyone was lost in their own thoughts except for those who had fainted from exhaustion.
It was the same with Kanya and Lena, who belonged to the headquarters.
It was natural for them to see their parents’ faces shimmering in the stars as they sat side by side.
Instead of shedding a tear, Lena leaned her shoulder on Kanya.
He still had a family to rely on, so even expressing his sorrow was not polite to the other rebels.
Chiing. Chiing.
Kanya’s face crumpled as she heard a calming metallic sound.
After patrolling the garrison according to the program, Babel was returning.
When not on duty, she is programmed to take care of Kanya and Lena.
It’s a part where you can feel Shirone’s consideration, but I thought it was even more terrible for Kanya.
enemies of parents.
To have to fight alongside a machine that penetrated his father’s torso.
“Applying the Syrone Algorithm. Protect Kanya and Lena. Mission accomplished.”
“shut up.”
The moment she heard Babel’s mechanical voice, Kanya’s patience snapped.
“Shut up!”
“The log is set to open.”
“Log? Are there any logs that killed my father?”
“Search complete. Data number 0342-24-6-46.”
“Shut up!”
Babel, who read the abnormal wavelength in Kanya’s voice, switched to emergency mode and muted it.
“You know what? do you have a family Do you feel the pain?”
Babel was silent.
It was the judgment with the best result among the many data she could choose from.
“Answer me. Tell me how you can be in the most pain!”
“I understand the pain. But there is no neural mechanism for feeling pain.”
Kanya gave a lively smile.
“okay? wait and see i will definitely find it When the war is over, I will destroy you in front of everyone’s eyes, horribly, humiliatingly, in the most scornful way in the world!”
Babel answered after a while.
“When the war is over, I will pay the price.”
As Kanya gritted her teeth and turned around, she heard the commander’s voice.
“Don’t get excited. I will save even that anger and pour it out tomorrow.”
“Commander.”
Kanya and Lena stood up at the same time and saluted.
“I can’t seem to sleep. Well, is it normal?”
Tomorrow, all the rebels will try to enter Arabbot, the center of Heaven.
No one wants to save their lives.
Maybe the month I see now could be the last month, so sleep wasn’t an important issue.
“Commander, at this time… … .”
Crude laughed bitterly.
“I can’t sleep either. But it’s good to keep your eyes closed. We are going to win, not to die.”
Kanya nodded coldly.
He knew what it meant when he left out the word “you can live” in Crude’s words.
Chiing!
Babel’s eyes suddenly lit up.
The red laser quickly scanned the front and immediately identified the behavior winner and reported it.
“Creature appeared 600 meters ahead. Thermal sensor operation. Body temperature 40.1 degrees. Target class ally. name. Ravid Flu.”

[487] Night in Heaven (5)
“Flu?”
Crude’s eyes flashed.
Fleur is a member of Shirone’s team, and they are moving on a completely different line from the rebels.
How did she come to this place?
As Kurd ran, Kanya and Lena followed, and Babel escorted them all by flying like a self-leverage.
“Flu!”
When Crud arrived, she was already on the floor unable to hold on.
“this… … !”
Flew was dressed as a subject, apparently stolen.
But even that was worn in places, and numerous wounds were visible between them.
‘I was terribly beaten.’
He had bruises all over his shoulders, thighs and calves, as if he had fallen from a high place.
“Hey, Crude… … .”
When a leaking sound came out of Fleur’s mouth, Crude hurriedly shouted.
“we are here. Where did you get so injured?”
“Shehakim… … .”
“Shehakim?”
Crude’s face turned into an embarrassing expression.
Is it that he ran such an incredible distance with this face?
“Something urgent… … very urgent… … .”
Flew passed out again, unable to finish his sentence.
Realizing that the condition is serious, Crude looked back at Kanya and Lena and said.
“I have to move at once. To the Nord infirmary!”
Babel immediately carried out the order.
Because the rebels were united, there were competent Norse mages on standby at the headquarters.
After pouring the flue into a huge tank of water and casting the water magic Orhiri, her wounds began to heal little by little.
After three hours, Flu was moved to the recovery room and his breathing was more even than before.
Crude, who had been awake for about an hour, opened the door to the recovery room and looked at her.
‘Flu… … .’
From the first time I saw her, she was a person who had a place in Crud’s heart.
Is there any reason?
No, maybe there is, but why bother thinking about what it is?
A personality as strong as a stubborn appearance.
The Shirone team are all people with a mysterious atmosphere, but among them, Fleur was the most mysterious to Crude.
In the world of Shirone, people who are perfectly specialized in the social system created by humans, not in heaven, are called professionals.
But at this moment, I couldn’t feel the knife-like vigilance I felt from her.
Maybe that’s why a woman who fell asleep is beautiful.
Crude’s hand moved slowly toward her forehead.
The pretext of wanting to know how hot the heat is is just self-justification, but in the end, his wish was not fulfilled by Flew’s brow furrowing.
“Huh!”
Crude hurriedly withdrew his hand, saw Fleur slowly open his eyes and spoke to him.
“How are you? Are you okay?”
“here is?”
As soon as Flew came to his senses, he linked his consciousness to his memory.
Then I did a quick search around.
A room with the characteristics of Mecca. And in front of her eyes, Crud was looking down at herself.
‘You’ve arrived. I don’t remember anything after I entered Matei.’
A distance that cannot be reached with only superhuman mental strength.
Had it not been for the help of the algorithm, he would have been caught and killed by the giant.
But even that relief was nothing compared to the crushing misery.
Mission failed.
Her mission is to safely transport Shirone to Arabot.
The fact that he did not play a proper role as a supporter shattered the pride of a top graduate of the Royal Magic School.
Crud couldn’t say anything at the sight of Fleur trembling with her mouth tightly closed and her fists clenched.
Perhaps, as the person who saved her life, she wanted at least a word of thanks, but in Fleur’s mind, only self-reproach for her failure and a way to make up for it lingered.
Having made her decision, Flew jumped to her feet.
Even though the wound was healed, the pain did not completely go away, but I clenched my teeth and endured it.
“How is the war situation? How far did you push it?”
As the story progressed to war, Crude put aside his emotions and spoke.
“More than half of them pushed through. The remaining distance to Arabot is about 40 kilometers. But the battles from now on will be different.”
Thanks to the fact that there was no activity of the angels and the firepower of the rebels was stronger than expected, we were able to achieve today’s results, but it was not just because we won in the logic of power.
“If you look at it calmly, you can see that the enemy’s defense radius was too wide. However, as you approach the center of the concentric circles, the defensive range will narrow and the density of enemies will increase.”
“Perhaps. Can you break through?”
“In my opinion… … impossible. Even if the forward distance is the same, the enemy’s density will jump at least 3 times. There will never be a situation where we can break through like yesterday.”
Crude said honestly.
Also, this was the reason why he couldn’t give Kanya and Lena any hope of life.
“Hmm, I guess.”
“It is something that cannot be wasted time. As soon as Heaven’s interceptor system Aegis is restored, gunfire will explode from all directions. supercharged kill. That is my strategy.”
Flu, realizing that there were bones in Crude’s words, turned her head.
“Is there an operation?”
“We will focus the rebels on Jebul. Destroying Heaven’s walls with Titans and crowding them out. And from there enter Arabot.”
Jebul is a city of powerful angels, but there are currently no angelic activities.
It was a strategy that felt like gambling to some extent, but it was definitely the only way the rebels had any chance of winning.
“But didn’t you say you had something to tell me?”
I heard that right before I lost consciousness.
But Flew was still lost in thought and was silent.
‘Mr. Sein… … .’
Just before departing from purgatory for heaven, Fleur received two special orders from Sein.
One is to move the Terminator to Arabot.
And this mission must be prioritized no matter what the circumstances.
Here, Sein gave one more mission.
“If Shirone arrives safely in Arabot, or if you fail to transport or leave the team due to some variable, you go see the rebel commander.”
“Mr. Crude?”
“We need to tell you about God’s punishment. Perhaps, if the second situation were to happen, the outcome of the war would most likely be in Syrone’s hands. It’s best to use it as much as possible, but it doesn’t matter if I tell you by then.”
It was a calculated yet humane judgment.
Once divine punishment has been invoked, there is no means to stop it.
Heaven will be destroyed and there will be explosions in a huge radius.
If the rebels were concentrated near Arrabot, they too could not escape death.
Even so, the reason I’ve been hiding it so far is a terribly selfish mind to make this project successful.
Flu wasn’t afraid.
Under any accusation, the mage carries out her mission.
Also, knowing her personality, Sain entrusted Fleur with the task of playing the villain.
“Before spreading the operation, I have something to tell you.”
Fleur told everything without hesitation.
Shirone’s magic will destroy heaven, and the time when the magic is cast is noon tomorrow at the latest.
It was impossible to guarantee success, but it was information that the rebels had to risk their lives for.
Upon hearing the truth, Crude’s face turned pale.
Arabot, the land of victory, quickly turned into a land of death.
If you advance, you die; if you retreat, you die.
was used
Hundreds of thousands of rebels were put on the list of life and death because of just a few from the land country.
“From the beginning… … You tricked us.”
No matter what his true intentions were, if he lost momentum, it would be the end, so Flew didn’t blink an eye.
“As the president of the association said, it wouldn’t be a bad suggestion for the rebels. Didn’t you risk your life to win the war anyway? then… … .”
“Now call it a horse!”
Crude threw away his usual cool-headedness and shouted out loud.
“You think giving your life for your beliefs is the same as dying at the hands of others! Then what the hell are we fighting for?”
Fleur kept her mouth shut.
Even if I tried to hold on, there was no way to refute it. Because it was like that from the beginning.
“Now what are you asking me to do? Should I tell the former crew? Even if you go to Arabot, the only thing waiting for you is death! Even at this moment, the crew can’t even sleep in fear! How are you supposed to talk to such people!”
“that… … .”
Flew gritted his teeth.
Desperately clearing his mind, he glared at Crude.
“It is none of my business.”
Crud’s eyes were filled with life.
Even in this moment of glaring to death, Flew was brazenly confident.
“shit! Shit!”
Crud knocked down all the equipment in the recovery room and walked to the door.
bang! The sound of the door closing violently seemed to represent his feelings.
Only after Crud left, Fleur frowned at the pain that afflicted her whole body.
‘How far did Shirone go?’
No, did he survive the shelling of the fairies?
If alive, you must go to Arabot to complete your last mission as a supporter.
Pushing Kubrick forward, she brought out Phoenix.
His stamina was significantly reduced, but as long as his limbs moved, he could not stop.
‘Wait a minute, Shirone… … .’
While Flew was leaving the rebel headquarters, Crude stood in front of the voice transmitter in the command and control room.
have to say
It is said that they fight to win, but at least each of them should be allowed to choose their own death.
“Inform the command staff.”
Crude’s voice was transmitted to each room through the airwaves.
Hundreds of simultaneous sounds echoed through the stillness of the night, echoing faintly in Fleur’s ears.
“I’m about to announce something important right now. At dawn, the war will resume, and we will win in the end. but… … .”
Crude paused for a moment.
I just couldn’t get it out of my mouth.
When instructions are given, information will spread rapidly through wireless communication, and tens of thousands of rebels will fight the fear of death tonight.
Wouldn’t even a commander have the right to plunge so many people into despair?
As the silence grew longer, the awakened crew members looked up at the speaker with puzzled eyes.
It was obviously not good news, so their eyes were gradually filled with anxiety.
“… … let’s fight.”
Crude’s locked voice continued.
“Let’s fight to the end.”
Crude gnashed his teeth and spat out words as if squeezing them out, and his eyes widened toward the darkness without a target.
You cannot give up here.
If you tell the truth to the rebels, despair will come one after another.
That would immediately lead to a weakening of power, and it was like presenting only miserable defeat to the crew members who were prepared to fight to the death.
‘I’m responsible for everything.’
Even if he becomes the worst commander in history, even if he is called a demon, he must lead everyone to death.
Crude cried out with hot tears.
“Will win! I will definitely win and get my freedom back! Today is the most brilliant day in our human history! Let’s all give up on living and fight!”
“Waaaaaaa!”
The determination of the commander in chief of the rebels was more effective than a short nap, and the soldiers shouted in numerous barracks.
A huge sound, like the whole radius, reached Flew’s ears as he left headquarters.
‘Fight. I will fight until the end.’
Even limping from the pain of the contusion all over her body, she did not slow down.
I could see the hazy dawn breaking over the distant horizon.
The last night in heaven was coming to an end.

‘It’s dawn.’
In the midst of the chaotic battle, Shirone sensed the sky brightening.
As Armand’s dilated pupils narrowed to let in as much light as possible, each Kergo warrior’s terrified expression was clearly visible.
“Kill! Don’t back down!”
Even the face of the Kergo tribe chief who shouted that way was pale.
They have trained their schema by hunting heresy for hundreds of years, but the Elysion that Shirone uses is truly an unknown territory.
The boundaries of the Spirit Zone disappeared, and dozens of photon cannons swept left and right as if scratching the space.
The enemy’s blades could not cut Armand, and the tentacles endlessly sucked up the corpses and gave Shirone vitality.
And when the multiple beams finally exploded, grotesque screams filled the surroundings.
Dozens of light sources were emitting light, crushing all Kergo hunting troops.
Left alone, Shirone’s eyes were filled with sadness.
I had dozens of reasons to go to war in my head, but every time a life was destroyed, the reason was also erased, and now I didn’t know what I was fighting for.
‘scary.’
As a wizard and as a member of Gaold’s team, I did not come to heaven without even this level of determination.
What was truly terrifying was his self-determination and lack of inspiration.
“Rian.”
Shirone’s cold face suddenly twisted and tears flowed down her face.
“It’s so scary, Rian.”
“There! chase! Never miss it!”
Again, heresy hunters came in pursuit.
As long as Shirone smells of blood, they will follow you everywhere.
As soon as the Kergo warrior approached as fast as an arrow and swung the sword vertically down, Akamai’s eyes activated the antithesis.
Armand’s tentacles burst the enemy’s face before he could stop the action.
The battle that followed was the same one-sided slaughter as before.
Kuzen’s ability to metabolize food does not allow Shirone to be fatigued.
Ringer’s armor does not allow wounds, and Kenser’s absolute restoration does not allow injuries.
The Ultima System, reinforced with all kinds of abilities, was imbuing magic into every space Jikji recognized.
Akamai subdued the enemies, Galtomic’s magical power amplification maximized its power, and enemies that approached were cut away by the blades of the tentacles.
‘shit! It’s a monster! I’m not human!’
The pursuers, who thought they only had the symbolism of the light of Area 73, were terrified when they encountered Shirone’s inaction, which was no different from a martial god.
‘Elysion!’
As Shirone’s eyes pierced the world with Jikji, numerous photon cannons were born from the ground and shot up into the sky.
It was a sight as if a huge flash of light stood up in a bunch.
It was extremely difficult for a human with eyes on his head to adapt to the attack from under his feet, and the enemies died without even getting close to Shirone.
After another battle, a wave of sorrow surged in.
“Peope.”
Shirone put her hand on her chest and checked Feope’s condition.
I didn’t stop breathing, but I felt that my vitality was far less than before.
That feeble vitality whipped Shirone’s mind.
“We have to go to Arabot.”
Shirone’s robes, darkened by the blood of countless people, quickly absorbed the blood and turned it into energy.
Based on that power, Shirone moved forward.
As the destination got closer, the number of pursuers began to decrease significantly.
It would not be without the influence of the divine aura of Arabot, but I thought that something big might have happened in other areas except Shehakim.
Finally, when the walls of Arabot came into view, Shirone cast teleportation and stopped in one place.
‘This is the first point.’
Sein designated three points where God’s Punishment could be cast, and Shirone also learned the falling trajectory accordingly.
Heaven will be destroyed if magic is cast here.
However, Shirone ignored the point and walked away.
In the absence of specific tactical instructions, God’s Punishment was promised to be cast at the closest point to Arabot.
However, do not exceed noon.
If there had been a flu, I would have been in a better position to judge, but the outcome would have been the same anyway.
‘I’m going to meet Ikael. Wait a minute, Peope.’
Shirone immediately jumped and crossed the walls of Arabot.
The Gaold team and the rebels were the first to arrive at Arabot.
At the second point, Shirone paused for a moment.
Even though he got close enough to see the spire where Anchera resided in the distance, there was no one to stop him.
The place where Shirone could finally meet someone was only two kilometers away from Arabot, where even the third point had been passed.
The archangel of amplification, Ikael, was waiting for Shirone with the spire on his back.
“You’re here at last, Shirone.”
How many dead lines have you crossed?
The eyes, which seemed to have dried up to dryness, did not convey any real emotions.
Even in the face of Ikael’s apparent hostility, Shirone did not waver in her gait.
“I have a favor to ask you.”
“I refuse. you and i are enemies If you come any further, you have no choice but to kill them. no… … .”
Ikael’s body leaned slowly.
The reason for blocking her heart was clear to her as well.
“I’ll kill you anyway.”
pop! The air exploded and Ikael’s figure disappeared.
The place where she appeared was right behind where Shirone was standing.
Ikael’s fist, which increased his speed and rushed in vain, cut through the air and stopped, and her brows narrowed.
Shirone was standing 10 meters away from Ikael.
Above her head, Ikasa’s judicial halo Valhalla action was spinning.
Although he was downgraded to a fallen angel and had most of his powers restrained, the power of the judicial halo is the same as that of other angels.
It was natural for Ikael to recall the connection of Ataraxia he had passed down after watching the Valhalla action.
‘To make full use of two angelic magics.’
It is impossible for anyone in Heaven, and therefore Shirone must die.
Having made up his mind, Ikael threw himself again.
It was such a fast movement that only afterimages could be seen even with Armand’s nervous system strengthening.
Perong! The air exploded again, and Ikael thrust out his fist.
“… … .”
But this time, Shirone’s figure had disappeared.
Ikasa’s Valhalla action must consume all the time required for the cause at the cost of preempting the effect.
It was definitely her judgment that gave Shirone time.
However, the reason why I didn’t think it was a mistake was because I thought it would never be avoided this time.
‘How did you see it?’
Ikael slowly turned his head to check Shirone, who had gone behind him before he knew it.
Armand’s tentacles fluttered and prepared to face him in earnest.
But the reason she was surprised was rather invisible.
The focal point of Shirone’s mind had disappeared.
And it was Gaia’s ability that clearly remained in her memory.
“Elysion?”
Ikael muttered involuntarily, frowning with a painful expression.
“Black!”
I had already organized my thoughts, but another sense was trying to connect with the other side of oblivion.
‘You shouldn’t try to remember.’
That is Ankera’s will.
Quickly recovering her mind, she suddenly changed again with cold eyes.
“You are much stronger. In just a few days.”
Recognize it with the Ultima system and evade it with Valhalla action.
It was certainly possible, but Ikael could only think of it as foolishness.
“Did you just try to deal with me that much?”
You can only avoid it once anyway.
Due to the nature of Valhalla’s action, if you apply a combo attack, you can never dodge it.
No, in fact there is no need for that.
Knowing Shirone’s level, it was enough to move fast enough to be undetectable even with a straight line.
When Shirone took out Peope from her arms, Ikael’s eyes turned to the skinny fairy.
“I am still alive. If it is you, you will be able to revive Feope.”
Feope was a name familiar to Ikael as well.
Because it was the fairy who brought Shirone when he first came to heaven.
But now it was a wartime situation, and Feope was a heretic who helped Shirone.
“Don’t get me wrong, Shirone. You can’t do any business with me. Will I be able to survive this time… … .”
“I know you can kill me.”
Ching!
A magic circle of Valhalla action was born on Shirone’s head.
“Because Archangel Ikael is probably the strongest being in heaven.”
“… … What do you want to say?”
Shirone looked up at the magic circle floating above her head and said.
“Valhalla action reverses cause and effect. It means that any action can lead to immediate results… … .”
Ikael’s voice became ferocious.
“Are you kidding the archangel?”
All the magic of the angels is in Ikael’s head.
Because she is the source of all justice.
“So I am explaining. If you have already reached the result, you will never be able to go back.”
Shirone turned her gaze to Ikael again.
“Right now, this Valhalla action is enchanted with many things. I’m going to amplify the laser with Ataraxia and shoot it into the sky. Then, at an altitude of 6,000 kilometers, a new magic will be cast. By using divine particles to compress mass. Then, a light spear with a mass of 10 tons in terms of this planet will be completed.”
Ikael’s face began to contort.
“And that spear will fall exactly on Arabot.”
“Shirone… … .”
It is possible.
Ikael, who preceded the destruction of Uriel and the birth of Kariel, could not have known that fact.
The biggest problem was the Valhalla action.
Shirone’s explanation was lengthy, but if you use Valhalla Action’s magic, it all happens in an instant.
“I’m sorry. By using the magic you taught me in this way. Points cannot be taught. You’ll be able to predict and kill me before casting the spell. But in the end there will be no way to stop me. so… … .”
Shirone held out Peope with a desperate look.
“Save this fairy. It became like this to save me. Let me do what I can.”
Ikael shook his head as if to shake off the conflict.
Peope is not the problem.
If Shirone invokes God’s Punishment, there won’t be many beings who can survive in heaven.
No, the power was expected to be strong enough to destroy even an archangel if it was hit directly.
“If you cast that magic, do you think you can live? The price of a Valhalla action will immobilize you for a very long time. If you do that, your life will also be lost.”
“You still don’t know?”
As Shirone approached, Ikael stepped back as if to keep his distance.
In terms of power, she is second to none in Heaven, but at present all options are left to Shirone.
“I have a mission to destroy Heaven. But I’m saying I’ll give up the mission if I let Feope live. so… … .”
At a distance closer than before, Shirone’s steps stopped abruptly.
“Whatever decision you make, it has nothing to do with me dying.”
Ikael’s nose wrinkled.
All circumstances and situations were perfectly organized in my head, but I couldn’t make any choice.
“… … .”
Perong. Perong.
In the midst of a very long silence, the sound of war guns came from the sky from the 1st to 6th heaven.

Chapter - 489 - New variable (2) 1.txt
===============================
[489] New variable (2)
Six hours before Shirone enters Arabot.
Ethella received a special order from Sein and arrived at the deep forest in the first thousand Sharmain.
‘It’s late. If you don’t come… … .’
Gaold asked the leader of the night army, Frankwine, to save one item, and in return, the night army was allowed free access to the 2nd Rebel Command, where Raysis was the commander.
The object that Gaold wanted to obtain through Night Blindness was an ancient artifact called a disc.
As the space-time of the maze disappeared, the coordinates also changed.
The old Metagate was rendered useless, so Gaold devised a plan to extract new coordinates from the Akashic Records.
Even if the parts change, the whole is perfect.
Therefore, as the space-time of the labyrinth disappears, new and accurate coordinates must be recorded in the Akashic Records.
It was a disk called Guffin’s relic that could extract the coordinates and input them into a new metagate.
After the erasure of the Guffin, no remains of the Guffin remain in Heaven.
However, some relics used in the ruins were still spread throughout Purgatory.
‘If I can’t get the disc, I’ll have to be stuck in heaven until humanity does something about it.’
Ethella also knows how difficult the mission is because she has done countless hunts in Purgatory.
Nevertheless, the reason Gaold made the proposal was because they were the Night League, the best organization in the community of Purgatory.
If they can’t do it, nobody can.
“I was wondering if someone was coming to meet me, and they sent such a beauty. She sure knows how to do business. A guy named Gaold.”
Deep in the forest, Frankwine’s voice was heard.
When Ethella turned her head, the shrubbery opened like a door, and Frankwine and Meatgun approached side by side.
Time was running out, so Ethella got to the point.
“Did you get anything?”
Meatgun took out a palm-sized square stone slab from his inner pocket and held it forward.
There is no way to confirm whether or not it is genuine, but the stone slab was engraved with henna and gave off a faint red glow.
‘There’s no reason to trade lies when you’ve already got everything you’ve got. I have to go to Jebul with this quickly.’
Perhaps by now, Armin, Siena, and Kuan and the others should have been heading to Ingris of Jebul.
It was Ethella’s mission instructed by Sein to deliver the disk there.
“thank you. Thanks to work… … .”
Ethella, who was approaching Meatgun, stopped abruptly.
An unusual murderous feeling penetrated straight into her heart, causing her heart to sink.
With the sound of a strong wind, Frankwine’s fist cut through Ethella’s temple.
Leaving behind an afterimage, Ethella bent her back and stepped back, unable to properly balance herself.
“What is this… … .”
The moment she looked at Frankwine’s face, Ethella had a hunch.
“Who are you?”
“Quack, well. Who is it?”
Frankwine’s temperament was different from before.
Of course, the fact that he is more like a bad person than a good person has been felt since the first meeting.
But this time it wasn’t just that.
It was so lopsided that it was rather plain, and a clean evil energy was spreading out.
‘How can humans… … ?’
The moment she saw a small dot wandering around in one of Frankwine’s pupils, Ethella took a combat stance.
fly.
A fly hovered around Frankwine’s eyes as if trapped in a glass globe.
“You were not human.”
“Keuk, know with honor. Because I chose you as the flare of my resurrection.”
With a bang, the soil on the floor exploded, and Frankwine’s body rushed towards Ethella.
‘Schema?’
A physical ability different from that.
The night-blind people came from a different place from Shirone’s world, and the way they used their powers was also different.
If Meat Gun distorts the three fields of time, space, and spirit to activate special abilities, Frank Wine was classified as a warrior who only strengthened physical abilities.
It was straight, but since it only aimed at vital points, Ethella couldn’t find room for a counterattack and was in a hurry to defend.
It would not be an exaggeration to say that Yin-Yang Wave Fist had all its true intentions in the final destruction, but the techniques that reached that point were being crushed by Frank Wine’s momentum.
As they retreated down the hillside, Frankwine approached, closing the distance.
Ethella crossed her arms and raised her guard.
At the same time, Frankwine grabbed her by the wrist and opened it wide to face her.
The moment I saw the wickedly torn corner of my mouth and the fly clinging to one of my pupils, I got goosebumps.
“Hehe, what should we do for our pretty girl?”
Ethella furrowed her thin eyebrows and swung her shin, striking Frankwine in the crotch.
Frankwine’s eyebrows twitched as he heard the sound of something being crushed.
In that state, the two couldn’t move for a long time, and finally Frankwine’s head slowly went down.
Dirty water was leaking from between the legs.
‘finished.’
Since vital points among vital points were destroyed, even the strongest would have no choice but to lose consciousness or die.
However, to the dismay of her expectations, Frank Wein’s head, looking down, slowly began to rise again.
“Hehe, it’s different from what it looks like. I don’t hate this again.”
Ethella froze, staring straight ahead, not even knowing that Frankwine had already let go of her wrist.
Even though it had only turned half a turn, the figure of Frankwine twisting his back looked like a whirlpool.
‘I have to stop… … .’
Realizing it belatedly, her arms came down to her abdomen again, but Frank Wein’s fists were already pressing down as if they were going to pierce the stomach through the border of the guard.
“Ouch!”
Ethella’s body, which uttered a muddy death sentence, was shot away like a cannonball.
Even after breaking down several thick trees, the speed of flight did not drop, and finally, a thud was heard from outside the line of sight.
“Are you okay?”
Meat Gun approached with a crooked head.
It would be presumptuous to worry about Frankwine, who boasts strong leadership to the extent that he swears absolute obedience, but since the affected part was the part, human sympathy was felt.
“What do you know? Whether it explodes or not.”
Frankwine grabbed his crotch, which was damp as if he had urinated on his pants, and shook it, then turned around.
“I’ll be going to Jebul, so finish it and come. I must be busy to take over heaven.”
Mitgan kept his head down until Frankwine had left, then watched his back as he walked away.
‘Satan… … .’
After many twists and turns, when Frank Wine arrived at the 2nd Headquarters with the disk in his hands, there was someone waiting for him.
A middle-aged man wearing a bowler hat, wearing glasses and holding a cane with both hands, introduced himself as Satan and asked Frankwine for a deal.
-Are you satisfied with being the ruler of purgatory? sell me your soul Then I’ll give you the whole heaven.
Selling your soul and eating heaven are things you have to think about, but Frankwine didn’t worry for a second.
Even in the original world, to him who sold anything for profit, the soul was nothing more than a useless currency.
Satan held out a fly in a small vial, and merged it with Frankwine through the Fusics Machine in the headquarters.
As Mitgan knows, the anecdote’s liquor is a method in which multiple creatures are melted and reborn into completely new forms, but strangely, the fly did not melt into Frankwine and settled in the pupil.
‘It’s just that they didn’t mix…’ … .’
Thought.
But that was the key concept and huge potential to eat heaven whole.
‘Follow the will of the boss. That’s the only fate of the second person.’
After thinking about it, Mitgan slowly moved to the spot where Ethella flew away.
Ethella sprawled under the spot where the ripples were formed on the huge rock wall.
Seeing that there was no movement, it was highly likely that he had stopped breathing, but he had to finish as Frank Wein ordered.
“Don’t be resentful. Everyone dies.”
Mitgan, who was sitting next to Ethella, took out a dagger from his bosom and raised it up, aiming it at the soft nape of her neck.
“It’s all about living.”
The moment he thrust the dagger down vertically with all his might, Ethella’s two hands, which jumped up to her feet, grabbed her wrists from left and right.

Fifth Thousand Matei.
The rebels were fiercely advancing in the city of huge giants that made both legs tremble just by looking at them.
Aboard the Titan Unit 1, Kruud took down the wall with a thermal flash cannon under the cover of numerous Kuroi troops.
You cannot enter Arabot by narrowing the siege.
The key was to somehow create a detour and gather the rebels, and the giant troops who realized that fact were punishing the rebels more violently than before.
The giants currently fighting the rebels were powerful warriors with a height of 15 meters who had reached the 4th level of anecdote.
Even Guro, who belonged to large-scale equipment, was only a child in front of the giant’s size, and the steel plates were being torn like paper by the iron swords they wielded.
‘It’s also hard to break through. I can’t go any deeper.’
Making a decision, Crude rapidly rotated the Titan sideways and began advancing toward the wall.
“Make a road here! All troops, follow me!”
The troops that received the radio communication began advancing toward the wall in a huge torrent.
“Damn it! damn it!”
Crud gritted his teeth.
The reason why the rebels throw everything at once and fight is to win.
to win and return home.
But Crude couldn’t give them a future.
The closer they got to Arabot, the more approaching was the end of tens of thousands of lives and the infinite possibilities they carried.
“Fluuuuuuuu!”
Unable to handle the rage that erupted, Crude called her name.
Wizard? cold-hearted reason?
Enticed by such things, the anger toward himself, who had once given her heart, came belatedly.
she was a witch
A witch without blood or tears.
Does Crud know?
In the world Flew lived in, wizards were called witches long ago.
“I will not forgive you! When this war is over… … !”
not afraid to die
But no matter what death comes, then her life will have to be with her.
The spectacle was unfolding as a huge army of machines flowed into Jebul through the collapsed walls.
The sixth thousand offerings.
Not a single ordinary angel was seen wandering around Jebul, putting the name of the city of angels to shame.
At the end of the gateway to Arabot, the archangels Methiel and Satiel stood side by side in the air, looking at the battlefield.
The walls are collapsing and the rebels are pouring in, but at present there is no force to stop them in Jebul.
absence of angels.
It was the biggest factor that made the war, which was thought to be easily pacified, sluggish.
The two beautiful archangels with flowing blonde hair did not look at each other.
The two concepts are strong and weak.
Their concept of origin, implied by the nuclear force, was huge enough to form the basis of all matter in the universe.
So two and one.
Their relationship was always not good because their nature was different from that of birth and destruction, Kariel and Uriel.
“The cheeky humans… … .”
Satiel’s face contorted.
Methiel’s personality wasn’t that good, but Satiel was much more tyrannical and cruel.
“I don’t understand. Why did you ban the activities of the angels? If the war is lost, there may come a situation where we have to obey humans.”
“I think it has something to do with Ikael. I don’t know why he suddenly reinstated her while her angelic activities were banned. And Ikael has a deep relationship with Shirone.”
“Hey, Shirone? What is there to be afraid of like the Nephilim?”
Mattiel’s eyes calmed down.
Satiel is like a twin brother who has been with her since birth.
That’s why I knew exactly when she started to go beyond being cold and cruel.
“Aren’t you jealous?”
When she turned to Methiel for the first time, Satiel’s eyes shook with murderous intent.
“what?”
“I mean, don’t be shaken. It’s already over. Guffin chose Ikael, not you. … .”
Aaaaaaaaaagh!
Satiel’s judicial halo unfurled with a frenzied sound.
“Say it again. I will destroy it right now.”
The archangel’s divinity could not be sensed in her expression, with her eyes wide open.

Chapter - 490 - New variables (3) 1.txt
===============================
[490] New variable (3)
Mattiel was silent.
It wasn’t that Satiel had such a cruel and cold personality from the beginning.
Rather, at the beginning of his birth, he was the most delicate and pure angel among the eight archangels.
McLean Guffin.
Although he had already departed from the world, his presence was still deeply rooted in this world and exerting influence.
Even to the spirit of Archangel Satiel.
“You’re approaching fast.”
Methiel looked at the battlefield and turned around.
It was by no means frightening of Satiel’s madness, but Ra’s will might work, so it was better to watch your mouth now.
When Methiel returned his words, Satiel also disarmed the halo of justice and looked around the battlefield again.
As the rebels came flooding in, the army of Heaven followed, but as expected, control was not working properly.
Even if it is one heaven, each sky is different.
The fact that there was no angel’s command combined with the unfamiliar strategy of bypassing the castle wall while taking advantage of the paralysis of the Aegis interception system was acting as an opportunity for the rebels.
“Aren’t we supposed to step in? And if you really do reach Arabot… … .”
“I already sent all Mara. Now you have to take action… … .”
Aaaaaaaaaaa!
Before Methiel could finish his words, a roar that shook the world was heard from the east of Jebul.
A huge black sphere with a diameter of 200 meters pushed away all objects and expanded, then sucked in everything in all directions.
If the scenery of Jebul was a painting, it was a heterogeneous scene as if it had been pressed with a brush, and the speed at which several tons of rocks rotate around a sphere seemed rather slow in front of a huge scale.
“That’s Metatron’s Gravity Steel. What happened?”
It is difficult to see that the archangel directly intervened in the battle, violating Ra’s instructions.
In particular, Metatron, whose mouth was destroyed for denying Ra’s will, deserved to be more self-respecting.
Methiel and Satiel opened their halos at the same time and peered into the Gravity River.
Nothing could be seen due to the power of gravity that sucked in even light, but as Metatron’s ability gradually disappeared, a scene was revealed.
“That… … .”
The eyes of the two archangels shook in shock.
‘The power of an angel… … It doesn’t work.’
Metatron murmured from the mouth of his mind.
If Ra hadn’t extinguished his mouth, he would probably have been staring at the person standing in front of him with a blank expression.
“Hehehe, is this the power of an archangel?”
Caught in the river of gravity, Frankwine pushed his strength into his muscular body while he was naked.
Her skin was reddish and the scars from Ethella were set in place, but her expression was still smiling.
“It’s nothing.”
The moment Frankwine spurred the ground, Metatron launched hundreds of gravity spheres, trapping him in a labyrinth of gravity from which he could never escape.
But to everyone’s surprise, Frankwine ignored all the force and came straight up and punched Metatron.
Metatron, who rolled over the ground with a massive body, fell on the floor with a look of disbelief.
“… … .”
He had no mouth, so he couldn’t even groan.
‘The source concept is not applied. That means… … .’
Having reached a conclusion, Metatron turned his head away with his eyes raised in disbelief.
Frankwine, with four triangles floating above his head, was walking towards me with an arrogant shrug of his shoulders.
‘Don’t quadruple. It’s Satan!’
If the angel’s halo symbolizes eternity, Mara’s triangle symbolizes absoluteness.
And all these concepts are integrated into a whole to form the Akashic Records.
But Satan has 4 horns.
This was a concept that could not be reached by the law, so Satan is not affected by any law.
‘The reason why the activities of the angels were banned was not because of the Nephilim. Ra is… … .’
Fearing the coming of Satan, the angels were evacuated.
In the end, it was the right choice.
Since Satan is an existence outside the law, he is the only concept that cannot be erased even with the Akashic Records.
Therefore, the most threatening variable in Heaven at present was neither the rebels nor the Nephilim, but Satan.
‘It must be removed now. When the angels are attacked, then no one can stop them.’
Since the Akashic Records are perfect, the number of laws is always 1.
However, there is a possibility of downgrading this fixed and unchanging status to a general concept by using special reasons.
In other words, it is assumed that there is a ‘something’ that refers to the whole outside the concept of the whole.
No one knows what ‘something’ is, but the moment you assume it exists, a concept arises.
From that point on, the Akashic Records are downgraded to the number 2 of the law, referring to ‘something’ and each other, eventually entering into a zero-sum game that the mage calls the seesaw of the law.
Satan is a being born from the subjunctive law that has no substance.
Perfect imperfection was the only concept that could destroy the Akashic Records as a law.
“I hear angels have high self-esteem, so why don’t we just give up? Before you get worse.”
Metatron shook his body and stood up.
I couldn’t hear the distinctive grand sound of spirit anymore, but the momentum was transmitted through the shimmering air.
‘End with this!’
As the judicial halo was activated, Frankwine’s surroundings bent towards a single point, like clear water being sucked into a funnel.
Frank Wein’s face was distorted by the ability to compress gravity and pierce a hole in space and time.
“Keuuugh!”
Then, the body bent as if it were spinning around the point, and quickly tightened toward the hole.
“Hehe, what is this… … It’s not even kidding.”
Suddenly, Frankwine’s body, which viciously tore his mouth, disappeared from space as if evaporating.
“… … !”
Metatron’s eyes widened in shock.
As Frankwine’s fist pierced his thick chest neatly, the glow above his head weakened like a candle with a burnt wick.
‘Isn’t that okay… … .’
The reason why angels are powerful is because they deal with the concept of the deep principle of this world that no creature has ever touched.
However, Satan, who ignores all these concepts, was the natural enemy of all angels, including the archangel.
Like a last struggle, the starlight that had been emitting light for a moment exploded like a piece of glass, and Metatron’s dull body fell over.
“A stupid guy.”
Frankwine unwrapped his fist as he looked down at the archangel, which was oxidizing and disappearing with light.
“Now, what will happen now?”
It was this piece of information that most appealed to Frankwine when Satan offered him a deal.
seesaw of the law.
Every time you annihilate angels, Frankwine’s law becomes stronger.
And now one of the original eight concepts has disappeared.
In other words, one-eighth of the principles that govern the world have been removed.
Passsss.
When Metatron’s corpse, which was transformed into dust of light and scattered into the air, completely disappeared, Frank Wein’s eyes opened wide.
His body began to convulse as the flies in his pupils ran wild.
“Oh oh! Ohhhh!”
A great force was rushing in.
As the muscles of the whole body expanded like balloons, his height rose to two meters and his skin turned red like blood.
Eyes glared upward viciously, teeth jutted out, and thick necks flowed down like mountains to shoulders.
“Hahahaha! Hahahahahaha!”
Frankwine’s voice, as he burst into flames toward the sky, was muddy, as if his muscles were being squeezed.
He lifted his head toward the building of Jebul, where he could see a cross-section of the building that had been severed by the gravity steel, and vigorously kicked off the ground and flew up.
When I entered the 23rd floor from the 43rd floor section, the subordinates of the night blind were lined up and waiting.
“Are you here, Captain!”
Frankwine smiled with an ugly face that had already lost its original appearance.
Every time he took a step, the pale wall, the symbol of an angel, shook with an ominous red shadow.
“Hey, shall we start playing in earnest from now on?”
Satan’s angel hunt has begun.
Jebul 13th floor.
Armin, Siena, and Kuan formed a team of three and were heading to Ingris, where the Akashic Records are located.
It was not difficult to infiltrate Jebul because the angels had not been active until now, but the problem was that there was no special option just because they arrived.
“Miss Ethella should bring the disk safely. I felt it even when I was making a deal, but there are a lot of suspicious corners, night blind people.”
Siena was thinking the same as Armin.
In particular, the leaders of the Night Blind, Frank Wine and Meat Gun, were the ones who exuded a unique temperament different from the members of the organization.
“Teacher Ethella will be fine. I know my skills better than anyone else.”
The reason why they couldn’t narrow the distance even though they lived together as teachers of the same age at Alpheas Magic School was awe of her.
Leaving behind the title of Bishop of the Karsis Monastery, she had a sincere heart for the world.
“okay. Mr. Zulu is also a strong person.”
Currently, Zulu is on a solo mission to find the Metagate.
It is presumed to be in the munitions factory in the basement of Jebul, but it was unknown what the outcome would be as it was a wartime situation.
The whole situation is precarious, but Armin is determined.
As the stop was lifted by the angel’s power, the timeline was filled again for Armin.
The only thing I was worried about was the maze.
is she all right?
Or did he die when Kariel’s magic circle exploded because he couldn’t time it?
‘Well, I’m not a wizard at the level I’m concerned about. protect Siena. Just think about it.’
Armin stopped and looked back at Siena.
“If a situation arises that you cannot handle, come behind me unconditionally. Because I can stop it at least once.”
“okay.”
Armin’s stop would certainly help, but Siena’s help was only part of a tactic.
“But make sure of this. If you cast Stop just to save me, I will never respect you again.”
“okay. Promise me.”
Armin answered without even thinking.
If he had been afraid of being hated by her, he would not have left the Ivory Tower and flown to heaven in the first place.
Whether she knew that or not, Siena snorted and hurried her steps again.
Watching the two of them conversing from the rear, Kuan didn’t feel so good.
What were you expecting?
Did he even anticipate that something new would happen out of nothing if he shared life and death together?
Since Siena came and made a proposal in person, did he even expect that there would be some expectations for her?
‘A poor guy.’
Siena has Armin.
The war is drawing to a close, and whichever side wins, this will be their grave.
“Only death will save me.”
“huh?”
Hearing Kuan’s muttering, Siena finally turned around.
He’s a person who doesn’t show emotions on a regular basis, but since he joined Jebul, he hasn’t even given a tactical opinion.
As if he couldn’t bear to cut someone, he was just straining his eyes and spreading his life.
‘He’s like a child in this way…’ … .’
When he reached the official 5th grade, he was the first to send a congratulatory letter, and when he sent a sudden transfer to propose a trip to heaven, he came running.
It doesn’t make sense to not know Kuan’s true feelings.
He still doesn’t show his emotions, but I could feel the sadness buried in his cool chill.
Siena smiled and made a mischievous joke.
“The same goes for Kuan. No matter what happens, the mission takes precedence over me, you know?”
It was a statement that subtly revealed that he was guessing Kuan’s feelings, and it was a statement that required a lot of courage from her.
However, Kuan still passed Siena indifferently without any change in expression, and only spat out resolutely.
“Do not worry. I don’t have the ability to protect anyone.”
An ivory tower wizard who has conquered time magic is guarding her.
He was grateful for Siena’s concern, but hated receiving sympathy under any circumstances.
‘What mistake did I make?’
A joke that would never have been told normally. Perhaps this would be the last time, so he mustered up courage.
Siena pursed her lips and looked at Kuan, who was moving away.
One leg was limp more than usual due to the accumulated fatigue, and perhaps that was why his back looked even more lonely.

[491] New variable (4)
“Hmm.”
The meat gun pushed power into the hand holding the dagger, but Ethella’s strength was strong enough to make her feel like a machine.
Even in the tense situation where the blade trembled in front of his neck, Meat Gun was the first to question.
‘What happened? I must have stopped breathing.’
Ethella’s eyes, which were wide open, gradually began to fill with vitality.
Yin-Yang Wave Fist Spiritualism.
It is a technique that momentarily stops breathing and increases the pressure in the abdominal cavity to explosively increase strength.
However, Frankwine’s attack power was so strong that he experienced a momentary cardiac arrest.
‘Even if it was a little late, it would have been dangerous.’
Ethella, who had regained full consciousness, slowly pushed Meatgun’s wrist away.
Feeling that it was not possible, Meat Gun gave up the thrust and flew away, and at the same time, Ethella’s kick surged.
Meat Gun, who almost suffered the same vital point that Frank Wein had suffered, stroked his groin in a chilling feeling.
If it was a boss who sold his soul to the devil, it was absolutely undesirable for him to be defeated there.
Ethella hurriedly stood up and took a fighting stance.
The area where she had been beaten still throbbed, but as she straightened her back, enduring the pain, she said as if she was firing at her.
“Are you crazy? Selling your soul to the devil.”
Ethella could not confirm the existence of Satan with her own eyes, but she intuited it only with the temperament of a monk.
Otherwise, no human being could contain such an evil.
“Because I’ve been doing business with the boss.”
Meatgun bent one side of his head and said.
“If it’s something you can sell, there’s nothing valuable.”
At the same time as Ethella spurred off the ground, Meat Gun also raised both fists and prepared to fight.
As the essence of Yin-Yang Wave Fist raged like a storm, Meat Gun was in a hurry to avoid the attack by bending his back without rest.
Mirror cycle – reflection of events.
The moment Ethella’s fist struck her side, the same impact exploded from her side.
“Kuk!”
Taking advantage of that opportunity, when the meat gun struck Ethella’s face, her body spun like a top and retreated several meters.
“You can’t touch me.”
Meatgun stroked his fists with a fearless attitude and slowly approached Ethella.
His ability, Mirror Cycle, perceives the body as a mirror and reflects the event itself.
This is an ability that can be manifested through the distortion of the three fields of time, space, and spirit that he uses in the world he used to live in.
The mind perceives a mirror that reflects the event, and distorts the space so that the mirror can be realized.
Finally, time is distorted until a mirror is implemented in a specific space, and the mind is projected into reality.
“It’s an embarrassing skill since it’s already been broken.”
In order to prevent the reflection of the incident, you need to break the mirror located in Meat Gun’s cognition.
Gaold had done it at headquarters, but Ethella’s fists still didn’t have a jaw.
“It’s too much to handle one woman.”
This time, Meat Gun tried to attack first.
Apart from the abnormal effect of realizing the ability to reflect events, the psychological pressure was enormous.
However, through long training, Ethella broke her fear and counterattacked against Meat Gun’s attack.
Ethella had the upper hand in Kwon’s technique, but there was no reason to avoid the meat gun.
“Huh!”
As all events entering the meat gun were reflected, waves began to spread through Ethella’s body.
As if standing in front of a mirror, Ethella fell into the illusion that she was hitting herself, not the meat gun.
That fact conveyed that if the final wave was applied here, it would be himself, not the meat gun, that would break.
“Because I can’t.”
Meatgun’s voice became faint and the cells of his whole body shook and even his consciousness was fading away.
‘Don’t give up! certainly… … !’
Frankwine must be stopped.
After being defeated by Arcane, her will for good grew stronger.
And finally, now that he had assumed his lifelong enemy, that will had filled his whole body and erased any doubt about goodness.
It felt like my head was being split open, but it wasn’t pain, it was a transcendent sense of liberation.
‘what?’
thud! thud! thud! thud! thud!
Every single blow from Ethella’s fist pierced the mirror cycle and delivered a crushing shock to Meatgun’s body.
Yin-Yang Wave Fist Secret Weapon – Transcendence of Divine Redemption.
‘Damn it!’
A technique that uses the power of incarnation to directly impact the opponent’s incarnation.
As the shock wave passed over Meatgun’s body and shook his mind, the mirror cycle began to crack little by little.
Thinking that it would be dangerous at this rate, Meatgun backed away, but his legs were already weak and staggered.
At the same time, Ethella rapidly approached and thrust out both hands and struck him in the stomach.
The effect of the mirror cycle was still being activated, but there was no hesitation in her gesture of destroying the mirror.
lightning field.
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!
Numerous waves swirling inside were swept away by a single wave, and a formidable shock wave exploded.
Meatgun, who had been hit in the stomach, slowly lowered his fists and stayed there for a long time.
After staggering back for a while, a gob of blood gushed out of his mouth.
“Huh!”
Ethella bent down and captured the waves spreading from her body with both fists clenched.
It’s thanks to the impact on Meatgun’s mind that it lowered the mirror’s sharpness, but even if it wasn’t for that, he would have made the same attack.
Unless you have that level of determination, you will not be able to pierce the opponent with the incarnation.
Ironically, that belief broke the enemy, and Ethella approached Meatgun, who fell sprawled on the floor.
“Don’t move. If we treat it now, we might be able to live.”
Meatgun did not react.
I have never lived a life begging for someone’s life.
“… … You are a strange woman.”
Meatgun raised his hand with difficulty, took out the disk from his inner pocket, and threw it at Ethella’s feet.
“Go to the boss.”
Meatgun’s eyes slowly closed.
“Maybe you will like it.”
Ethella put the disk in her bosom and bowed her head toward Meatgun’s corpse, mourning the death.
“Whoa!”
And when she opened her eyes again, Ethella’s eyes were shining much clearer than before fighting Meat Gun.
‘I can feel it, where he is.’
It was only after awakening to incarnation that everything became clear.
Frankwine’s incarnation was not human.
absolute evil.
A huge evil spirit was blowing from far away on the wind.
* * *
Kururrureung!
The walls of Heaven were crumbling on all sides.
The noise that resonated with the heavens and earth was so great that even if someone shouted right next to them, they couldn’t hear it, and the rising dust made it impossible to see an inch ahead.
Despite the loss of sight and hearing, the advance of the rebels showed no signs of stopping.
“sister! Only 10 kilometers to Arrabot!”
Upon hearing Lena’s communication, Kanya’s eyes began to see the light of hope for the first time.
While most of the rebels fled to Jebul through the collapsed walls, the 1st Command remained in Matei until the end and continued to advance.
Currently, Matei was the only strategic point that could block the road to Jebul, and someone had to remain and block the enemy’s pursuit.
‘can win! I can really win!’
The war is over when it reaches Araboth and Ankera.
because it doesn’t move.
Being an absolute being like the sun, Ra will neither fight nor run away.
Kanya looked in all directions through multivision.
No one spares their lives and fights fiercely, but it was the machine, not the human, that achieved outstanding results.
The archangel’s ancient weapon, Babel.
The power output from the powerful engine was beyond the might of a giant, and the blade-like fingertips cut through tough muscles with ease.
‘amazing. Whoever made that… … .’
Kanya abruptly stopped thinking.
As a Mecca, she also feels awe at the design of Babel, but admiring the enemy was unacceptable.
-Enemy in sight! It’s a big army!
After hearing the communication, Kanya suddenly came to her senses and looked at her vision.
Indeed, an enormous army of giants was rushing towards them, filling their field of view.
“We will take it! Give me cover!”
When the 120 Norse troops stopped fighting and prepared collective magic, the Kuroi troops escorted them in perfect order.
Estacion, an ancient magic that is only possible when more than 100 wizards connect their minds.
The atmosphere in a radius of 100 meters was torn to pieces and began to cut the flesh of the giant troops.
“Whoa!”
Even though he was watching through his vision, he felt the ferocious power of magic with his own skin.
“sister! It doesn’t work!”
Lena shouted in a frightened voice.
Even after being hit by Estacion, no one in the giant unit was defeated.
The basic durability itself is different from the giants that have fought so far.
They were executives who had reached the 5th level of Anecdotal Liquor.
“Trample the enemies! They are just worms!”
Each giant wielded a weapon and destroyed the rebel camp.
Every time the blade flashed, Kuroi was cut off, and people flew left and right with only the sword wind.
– Activate map weapon. Codename Babel.
Babel, who came down to the ground, transformed into a map weapon mode.
His upper body opened wide, his limbs stuck into the ground, and he aimed the gun barrel with a giant glass ball at the giants.
Puff pup pup pup pup!
As photoelectric cannons were fired in bundles, holes were pierced in the bodies of the giants that were filling up the field of vision.
Kanya, as well as all the rebels, watched the scene in awe.
The only feeling they felt was a small but very realistic feeling that maybe they could win.
“The struggling of the insects is so terrible that I can’t bear to see it.”
There was one giant watching the confrontation between a giant and a human on the wall of Matei.
Giant Corps Commander Girshin.
Standing 3 meters tall and flapping a black cloak, he held a long, broad double-edged sword in his hand.
Having reached the 7th level of Anecdotal Art, he was never inferior to Ymir at the 10th level, but he was the absolute No. 2 among the giants in terms of arms.
“Ymir, I will end the war on your behalf.”
Girshin kicked off the wall and jumped to the ground.
As soon as he arrived, he rotated and swung his sword, and the rebels within a radius of 10 meters were split in two without knowing what they were doing.
“Enemies! Siege!”
The rebels who discovered Girshin turned their bodies in unison.
Even now, they did not know what kind of monster the person standing in front of them was, and when they realized it, their brain and body had already been separated.
Kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa!
Girshin did not stop and ran to the heart of the rebels.
Like the wind playing with feathers, every time he moved, humans swung around, and every time he swung his sword, blood flowed to heaven.
“Lena! Dangerous!”
Kanya, confirmed through the multi-vision, rapidly twisted Kuroi’s direction.
Even just by looking at Girshin’s sword, he felt that he was an opponent on a different level from the enemies he had fought so far.
The moment Girshin, who reached through the rebels in a straight line, raised a double-edged sword at Lena, Kanya blocked the way and aimed her gun barrel at her.
“A foolish thing.”
Before he could even pull the trigger, the gun barrel was slashed and the body immediately split in two.
As the c*ckpit fell to the floor, a tremendous shock was transmitted, but Kanya desperately held on to her spirit.
Girshin was seen wielding a sword on every screen in Multivision.
“Kuk!”
At the same time as pressing the emergency escape button, Kuroi was separated like a piece.
Lena, who was rolling on the ground as the chair protruded out, looked around without taking time to look for herself.
“Lena!”
Girshin passed Kuroi, which had been cut into pieces, and charged Lena.
“No eh eh eh!”
The moment Kanya’s heart stopped along with Lena’s life, a gray flash flew in and blocked Girshin’s path.
Kaaaaaaaaaa!
Even in the chaotic noise, iron and iron’s ripples clearly pierced Kanya’s ears.
“Hoo?”
At the appearance of the mechanical device that blocked the 7th level giant’s physical strength, Guru raised an eyebrow.
“I remember. It used to be fun.”
“Babel protects Kanya and Lena.”
Kanya hurriedly crawled over to Lena and hugged her sister who passed out from shock.
“why?”
There is no reason for Babel to release the map weapon in the midst of battle and come to save his brother and himself.
Because it is a very human judgment.
Even in Shirone’s algorithm, protecting Kanya and Lena is the third priority option.
But that’s why Babel moved.
It’s a fact that Kanya will never know, but from the moment Girshin appeared, her first and second priorities were erased.
And that also meant that the probability of victory obtained through Babel’s transcendent calculation converged to 0%.

[492] New variable (5)
thud! thud!
At Matei’s castle, the giant guards who have reached level 6 of Anecdote have begun to mobilize.
Their heads, nearly 80 meters tall, reached the sky, and when they looked down, humans and machines looked like bugs.
As the giant foot slammed the ground, countless rebels and Kuroi were crushed flat at the same time.
The only one who could see the giant’s face was the pilot aboard the Titan, a mecha-level 3 system.
Crude swallowed saliva at the sight of 20 giants striding past the rebels spread like grains of sand.
Even when he was a subject, he was a giant among giants that he couldn’t even take a look at.
It was only when he saw them that he realized.
The fact that it was an unwinnable war from the beginning.
“Do not be ridiculous!”
Crud struggled to deny the fear rising in his heart and pushed the Titans forward.
Giants of tremendous size used the power of the schema and jumped toward the Titans as swiftly as small humans.
Aaaaaaaang!
When the giant’s fist struck the Titan’s fuselage, all the drive joints in the waist part turned and staggered.
“Aww!”
He momentarily grabbed the center of gravity of the aircraft, but as he took a few steps back, his allies were crushed.
Crude was not even aware of their deaths.
It was the same as rebels and giants dying in the middle of a hand-to-hand combat between huge creatures and machines.
“Damn it!”
Crude hit the giant with a powerful attack using the recoil of the aircraft.
The Titan’s output was beyond imagination, but the schema of the 6th-level giants in anecdotal art was also overlapping, and it was exerting power impossible as a creature.
Aaaaaaang!
A heat flash cannon fired from close range grazed the giant’s shoulder.
The giant, whose shoulder had bluntly disappeared, screamed as if heaven and earth were about to leave, but the wound quickly healed.
The process in which the nerves and muscles thicker than a giant tree stand up and become entangled like a vine can be said to resemble the birth of nature.
As the furious giants rushed in and pounded the Titans, the rebels on the ground received the illusion that thunder was bursting from the dry sky.
Titan’s mechanical parts exploded, sending tons of debris crashing down on the guroi and giants.
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooh!
Finally, the engine exploded, paralyzing the control system, and the Titan slowly began to fall on its side.
“Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!”
Crude measured the timing, feeling with his body that he was plummeting dozens of meters down.
And just before hitting the ground, he pressed the emergency escape button.
As the c*ckpit opened, one Kuroi bounced up and crashed vertically.
Crude lost consciousness for a moment, then came to his senses.
Mecha second-stage system Kuroi was also inoperable due to the impact of the fall.
He looked up at the sky as he sat in the c*ckpit.
It was only the sky through the vision, but the sun rising towards noon was terribly bright.
Under the sun, endless giants were destroying another titan.
“This place… … Hell.”
The giant’s feet were falling down from a height of several tens of meters.
It wasn’t really aimed at Crude, but it was obvious what would happen if he lay there like this.
Pressing the emergency escape button again, Crude jumped out of Kuroi and landed on the floor with the power of Mecha Phase 1 System Piper.
I can’t turn back once I’ve come this far.
All that was left for the rebels was forward, and forward.
“I will go till the end.”
To Arabot, where Ankera is waiting.
When he finished his resolution and raised his head, Crude’s eyes were filled with fear.
“what… … hey… … ?”
A tremendously ominous aura was swirling in Arabot beyond the giant’s castle.
A strange sound of wind, as if calling to death, was heard in the landscape, as if the whole of Arabot was ablaze with black flames.
oh oh oh oh oh!
Crude’s face turned into a tear-stained face.
only death.
His steely will was melting like molten iron due to the energy so strong that he was certain that he would surely die the moment he entered Arabot.
What the heck is there?
The fleeting doubt disappeared in an instant in the face of the fear of extinction.
‘You must retreat. Everyone has to run away. That’s the only way we can live.’
Reaching for his personal communications device, Crude decided to admit that the war had been lost.
“All troops… … !”
Once exhaled, there is no going back.
Even if it was enough to overturn, the will that collapsed the moment he admitted defeat could never stand up.
‘There’s no way I can win!’
Just when Crude was breathing heavily and was about to issue orders to the entire rebel army, a woman caught his eye.
Flew broke through the barrage of giants and ran, staring straight into the terrifying flames of Arabot.
Did you come all the way here?
“It was an unwinnable war from the beginning.”
But why does she go to the center of extinction where the only thing waiting for is death?
“Damn it! I won’t be swayed by the likes of you!”
Crewd stood up with his eyes glaring viciously, set Piper’s functions to maximum and kicked the ground.
* * *
Jebul B11 floor.
In the basement of Jebul, there was a favorite child created by the intellect of countless angels.
Heaven’s munitions factory, Zion.
Everything produced in heaven comes from here, and Kariel’s Great Code and Uriel’s Paradise were no exception.
Beneath the endlessly stretched steel bridge, countless machines whose functions were incomprehensible sputtered molten iron and spun back and forth.
“The road is complicated.”
Zulu found his way down underground, perceiving the maze of paths of the iron bridges from a distance.
On his shoulder sat a small, broad-billed black bird.
It was Erga, a Tier 10 monster that Zulu first successfully summoned when he was three years old.
Although she had no special abilities other than imitating human words, she always kept Erga by her side when she was walking alone on a dark road like now.
“side. side. side. side.”
Erga jumped off Zulu’s shoulder, passed under the steel bridge, and imitated the sucking of a black nipple.
“Yes, there you are.”
Zulu chose the third leg from a six-pronged bridge.
The stairs leading down were hidden behind a railing.
-Why do you want to go alone?
When Zulu offered to find Metagate alone, Sain couldn’t understand her judgment.
Ethella must be separated to meet Frankwine, but Ingris and Shion are equally at the same fire.
If so, it would be better to join Armin and move together to succeed in the mission, but Zulu desperately wanted to go alone.
– That side is better for me.
Sane, who had been pondering Zulu’s words, did not object any longer, and in doing so, she was able to find the Meta Gate production plant at the southern end of Zion.
Numerous meta gates were wandering around the trailer that was connected like a belt.
A place that no human being could easily enter if it were not for the special situation of exhibition.
No matter how high the value of the meta gate is in the land country, it was a sight that would make you feel materialistic, but Zulu’s eyes were just as calm as the first time.
“Are you trying to figure out how to get rid of all kinds of troubles?”
At the sound of a woman’s voice on the other side of the trailer, Zulu stopped reaching for the meta gate and turned his head.
It was a naked woman with four arms, with black skin and eyes that were torn like snakes, and even the pupils that were immersed in light were sucking in light.
Zulu checked the number of red triangles floating above the woman’s head.
Triangular Maracaly.
He was a direct follower of the archangel of extinction, Faiel.
‘strong.’
Zulu lowered her eyes coldly.
She came to heaven and personally realized the incompetence of the three-legged Mara, but the Mara in front of her was emitting a different energy that was different from the other Maras, apart from the force.
“When there is a time to come, there is a time to go. It’s just to follow the rules. Do not interrupt.”
It wasn’t a slightly funny continental word, nor was it a voice that made people feel at ease.
“Hindrance?”
As Kali spread her four arms and spread her palms wide, a sword and shield, a whip and a skull were clutched in each hand.
“No creature can stand against the god of death.”
As Kali’s sword slashed, black lines cut through space and rushed at Zulu.
Zulu, who evaded by teleportation, destroyed Erga and summoned a tier 3 monster, Cougar.
Aaaaaang!
A huge beast approached and swung its sharp claws as if to chew and swallow Kali at any moment.
Aaaaaang!
The moment Kali’s shield blocked her claws, black smoke rose and enveloped the cougar’s body.
“Kuaaaaa!”
The cougar’s hair evaporated, dark spots formed on its skin, and pus filled it as if it were putrefying.
Kali’s four weapons all contain the concept of death, and among them, the shield causes diseases that cause the fastest death, making it impossible for any creature to survive.
“All living things must fall at my feet.”
Carly removed her shield and swung her sword, cutting the cougar’s massive body in half.
Cougars belong to the highest level of summoned monsters and have the strongest physical power among monsters that Zulu can use.
side side side side side.
After subduing such a cougar in one shot, the sucking sound of the blackmail nipple that Zulu was biting was heard even faster.
“Now, choose. What kind of death suits you?”
Carly smiled wickedly and threw her torso wide open, her black legs loosening into smoke and her body floating.
“… … This is dangerous.”
Zulu truly thought so.
* * *
“Huh. Whoa.”
Numerous angels were holding their stomachs and sobbing along the corridor of Jebul.
At the end of that humiliating spectacle, Frank Wein, who had made a pact with Satan, stood with an arrogant expression on his face.
In the back, night-blind servants who had transformed into ugly faces looked around with ferocious eyes in search of another angel.
“Kikiki! More, more angels… … .”
Although Satan is free from the power of angels, we know how strong they are from the beginning of history.
Even if the concept of angels is destroyed, if they unite and attack only with their physical abilities, the outcome is unknown.
That is why Satan sought the easiest and most convenient way to kill angels.
The result was the subordinates of night blindness combined with Garas.
“Huh! Does it exist like this… … .”
Sensing that the seed of Garas was growing in the belly, the angel closed his eyes tightly and turned the halo backwards.
With a bang, the angel’s body turned into light and disappeared.
Shame.
It was a more terrifying feeling than extinction to the angels who prided themselves on having a noble spirit.
Starting with the disappearance of one angel, all the fallen angels in the corridor rotated their halos to erase their existence.
“Cheuk, Lacey was stupid.”
Using the nature of Galas to obtain strong power?
“No, it just needs to be Garas.”
When all the angels in front of him committed suicide, the sense of Satan’s presence began to build with a stronger force by the seesaw of the law.
“Oohhhhh!”
It grew even larger, and horns protruded from its temples, bending it to its feet.
As he clenched his fists while wriggling his pectoral muscles thick like gloves, flames of deterioration flared up.
“Not yet. We need a little more.”
Satan, who was staring at his fists with fangs on his chin, shouted as he shot sparks down the hallway.
“good! Find every single angel! And trample! Heaven is our world from now on!”
“Kiaaaaaa!”
Dozens of henchmen, transformed into the form of Garas, jumped towards the blazing flames at the end of the corridor.
Angel’s banquet hall.
“Black. Sobbing.”
While the angels who were attacked by Garas annihilated their existence, only one angel escaped and hid in the empty banquet hall.
But she couldn’t break the rules of the law, and her stomach was gradually swelling.
Angel of Achievement Adio.
Because she was so happy to exist in this world, she couldn’t bear to leave even after knowing the outcome.
“I don’t want to disappear. How many things do I have to do?”
“Great angel.”
From the 1st to the 3rd, while the three Maras were guarding Adio, Rubel, the lingering Mara, said.
“Please be patient.”
It was the only consolation I could offer.
Even if the seed of Garas was conceived, it would not go to extinction if it had the durability of an angel.
But what does that mean?
Aside from the damage inflicted on the body, the psychological shock of giving birth to a monster child to an angel who handles concepts must have been enormous.
“Oh, no! Aaaaa!”
At the same time as Adio raised his eyes wide and screamed, the ship exploded with a bang.
Her starlight shook like crazy, and according to the law of the family, the three Maras disappeared without existing in reality.
“Hey, heuuuuuuuuuuuu!”
Adio fell to the floor and cried miserable tears.
What I realize now is that from the beginning, I should have chosen annihilation just like the other angels.
kook. kook.
The creature that had escaped from Adio’s body was ignoring its mother and escaping through the door of the banquet hall.
It was the birth of the Nephilim, which no one wanted.

Chapter - 493 - That Afternoon (1) 1.txt
===============================
[493] That afternoon (1)
As the midday sun shone over Arabot, Shirone and Ikael stared at each other in silence for a long time.
The Valhalla action was still spinning above Shirone’s head, and Ikael’s eyes were terribly cold.
‘Destroy Heaven?’
According to the theory of magic explained by Shirone, it is absolutely not impossible.
Then, this time, I must kill him.
Ikael’s fine fingers tightened and curled up like the claws of a beast.
Even so, the reason why he can’t jump out is because of Shirone’s Jikji, which reads the opponent’s temperament while revealing his murderous intent.
‘No, it’s not like that.’
If Feope is revived, Shirone said that Heaven will not be destroyed.
It wasn’t particularly difficult for Ikael, and the Shirone she knew wasn’t the type to take back words.
It was a wiser choice to accept the offer than to bet on uncertain assumptions.
‘No, it’s not like that.’
Ikael frowned.
Certainly, Shirone’s ataraxia was an ability she had passed on through possession.
As I assimilated with Shirone’s spirit, I felt a lot of admiration, pride, and sorrow for him.
‘I don’t remember.’
Most of them came to her mind clearly, but the problem was the feeling of sadness.
‘What do I want to do with that boy?’
My mind began to wander again.
Ikael couldn’t define his feelings for Shirone in clear language.
love?
It’s too shallow to simply say love.
Without digging deep into his emotions, Ikael finally made up his mind.
‘It must be killed.’
I can’t believe Shirone.
No, what I can’t believe is rather myself.
Trying to analyze someone with an imperfect memory is not good in any case.
‘All I have to do is do what I can.’
Ikael, who made that decision, said.
“great. I will revive Peope. However, you must keep your promise.”
“As long as I can save Peope, I don’t care.”
Shirone looked at the little fairy in her hand with pity.
I still don’t know if this was a good decision.
However, Feope wasted nearly an eternity of life to save herself and shrunk into a miserable appearance.
‘We have to save Feope.’
Right now, that was all.
“Put the fairy down in front of me. Amplifying vitality is a highly sensitive task.”
This was the biggest reason Ikael didn’t choose the deal.
Once Ataraxia begins to activate, you must focus all your attention on Feope.
If it was Jikji’s Shirone, he would be able to accurately dig into that gap and deliver a fatal blow.
It was not a strategy to be used in front of an unreliable opponent.
“don’t worry. I won’t do anything until Feope comes back to life.”
“please… … .”
When Ikael answered in an insipid tone, Shirone also approached slowly, remaining vigilant.
‘kill. kill. kill.’
Looking at Shirone narrowing the distance, Ikael kept repeating the same thought.
If the distance is a little closer, even if you feel the temperament of Jikji, your heart will be pulled out without even reacting.
‘Now!’
Shirone was moving her steps calmly.
‘now!’
Even as he approached Ikael and slowly lowered his body and set Feope to the ground, she did not move.
‘now! now! now!’
Ikael finally realized.
‘now… … .’
The fact that what is running madly in your mind is just a thought.
“You can’t kill me.”
Putting Feofe down and stepping back slowly, Shirone looked at Ikael with sad eyes.
It’s not that I couldn’t guess Ikael’s intentions.
Maybe it could be… … So he was on guard, but at the same time he thought it didn’t matter.
If Ikael kills himself, even the reason he risked his life to come to heaven will disappear.
However, Ikael was unable to kill Shirone in the end, and Shirone was satisfied with that.
Just to meet her, countless people have already been sacrificed and countless lives have been killed.
‘Okay, I’ll end it with this.’
Contrary to Shirone’s thoughts, Ikael was even more unknown.
“How do you know that? Why can’t I kill you?”
The words she had been holding so far rose to her throat, but Shirone swallowed them with effort.
He knew that if Ikael had already lost his memory, no matter what he said, he would only get hurt.
If there is only one, only hope… … .
“I don’t know either.”
“But you… … .”
“I really don’t know. I don’t know, so I’m here to meet you. But you can’t tell me anything.”
Shirone gritted her teeth as she suppressed the rising sadness.
“Why don’t you try to remember me? You can do it.”
Ikael kept his mouth shut.
It wasn’t that she didn’t think that what Shirone thought was her.
If Ankera didn’t reset, but just cut out the memory, maybe Ikael can find his memory again.
However, it was a direct disobedience to Ankera’s will, and it was not something that would end as a reaction.
Shirone looked down at Feope and stepped back, receiving a small wound from Ikael’s silence.
Not saying anything was a good thing.
“Enough now. Save Feope. Then I will do whatever you want.”
Ikael’s gaze turned to Peope.
If you can’t kill or not kill, in the end, making a contract with Shirone was the best option.
“… … All right.”
Ikael knelt down slowly in front of Feofe, put both hands on his knees and closed his eyes.
Chee Hee Hee Hee!
As the planetary body expanded, Ataraxia, the symbol of Ikael, rotated while emitting a brilliant five-color light.
Shirone watched in rapture with her eyes half-closed.
He can also use Ataraxia, but no one will be able to imitate the beauty of the original.
‘Amplify vitality… … .’
save peope
Reviving a fairy who was about to die at the cost of spending all her life was as difficult as giving it a new life, but it was not impossible for Ikael, who handled amplification as a source concept.
‘It will take time though.’
Ikael emptied his mind and held out his hand to Feope.
‘Shirone will keep his promise.’
When I made that decision, strangely, a sense of calm came to me.
He was still calculating all the variables in his head, but the moment he believed in Shirone, he was so calm and happy that he was sure that this was right, and Ikael smiled slightly without realizing it.
However, her expression soon turned cold, and she focused on activating her ability with emotionless eyes.
Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo!
Then the ground began to rumble west of Arabot.
The moment Shirone, who was very nervous, hurriedly looked back at the place, his eyes shook in shock.
An indescribable dark and shady aura was pouring in from afar.
Shirone felt the temperament through Jikji and got goosebumps from the fear running through her whole body.
Black dots studded like dots rotated like a whirlpool, casting a thick darkness around the person spreading fear.
“Fail?”
The archangel of extinction, Faiel.
In an unexpected situation even for Ikael, her eyes shook with anxiety.
If Ekael of Amplification was born first of the eight huge concepts, Fael of Extinction is the last one.
Therefore, it was extremely rare even in the history of heaven for two archangels to collide over a single event.
And the law of consequences always sided with extinction.
“Payel! Don’t come closer!”
Faiel’s existence was for one purpose, so his intention for appearing here was also self-evident.
Winning or losing a war doesn’t matter.
Faiel was coming here to put an end to everything.
“Archangel Ikael… … .”
Even though he was still far away, his voice hovered over Arabot in a black whirlpool.
Shirone desperately tried to calm down the fear rising in her heart.
Fael’s appearance itself was unattractive.
At 1 meter 70 cm tall, he could be called a dwarf among angels, and although he wore a white robe, his face covered by a hood was completely dark.
“From now on I deny you.”
oh oh oh oh oh!
Inside Faiel’s hood, a face was finally revealed.
No, can this be called a face?
In the darkness, only the shape of the wickedly torn eyes and the jagged lips like thorns were engraved with light.
oh oh oh oh oh!
As the darkness around him distorted and his face revealed under the hood was projected, his celestial body turned into a black halo and began to spin like ink.
“Huh!”
Feeling as if her vitality was drained just by being exposed to the aura, Shirone clenched her teeth.
Armand’s tentacles dried up like dried leaves, and chills ran through his body, like ice water running down his bones.
“Destroy, Ikael.”
At the same time as Faiel jumped away, Ikael jumped up and ran away.
amplification and extinction.
It was possible to know which side had the upper hand in the match without even having to clash.
As Ikael watched her movements from a distance of 100 meters, Faiel looked at her for a moment and then turned to Shirone.
“Foolish Nephilim. Trying to destroy heaven with mere human desires.”
Faiel raised his hand, and Feope’s corpse slowly floated up.
Having reached a terrible idea, Shirone shouted as she rotated the halo of the Valhalla Action even faster.
“no! Let go of Peope!”
“All life perishes. just follow the rules It will be the same for you.”
“Don’t touch Feope. I will kill Ra, whom you care so terribly!”
Faiel slightly raised his head as if looking at Shirone’s halo.
I had already checked what results were attached to the Valhalla action through looking down.
However, he had no regrets about the destruction of heaven.
It was just that, as the archangel of extinction, I could no longer watch the archangel of amplification being destroyed.
“For me, the only outcome is extinction.”
“No eh eh eh!”
The moment Shirone shouted, Faiel clenched his fists.
The black smoke seeped into Peope’s body and turned to black powder like ashes left over from a fire and flew away.
“Pe, Peope… … .”
Shirone looked at the powder with a bewildered expression.
Extinct.
They vanished from the world in vain, without the possibility of regeneration or the opportunity to be treated with respect for death.
“Black! Whoops!”
Shirone bit his molars and clenched his fists.
There was no thought that I had to hold back the flowing tears, nor that I should not appear weak in front of the enemy.
Deep anger begins to sprout from the depths of the heart.
And that sprout expanded at a tremendous speed and soon filled Shirone’s head.
“I will not forgive you.”
Judicial Halo – Valhalla Action.
As the Valhalla action was activated, ataraxia unfolded in an instant, and Shirone’s body disappeared.
“Foolish Fael! Are you going to endanger Ra!”
Faiel, who was looking at the place where Shirone had moved, turned his head after hearing Ikael’s cry.
The face in the dark was still smiling, but the voice was cold and solemn.
“You are foolish, Ikael. Do you still not know, what awaits at the end of this war?”
“What is that… … !”
Flash!
Before Ikael could finish his words, a huge red light shot into the sky from afar.
An estimated power of 2.19 million kilobusters.
Among Shirone’s magic, God’s Punishment, which boasts the most destructive power, has begun to activate.
—————————————

Chapter - 494 - That Afternoon (2).txt
===============================
[494] That afternoon (2)
The laser shot into the sky through the Valhalla action instantly reversed cause and effect, concentrating Amgu’s magic in the sky 6,000 kilometers in the sky.
Amgu borrowed the battery of God’s Particles and sucked in mass at an terrifying speed, and finally a spear of light with a mass of 10 tons was born.
The planet’s gravitational force pulled its 10-ton mass strongly, and light with great kinetic energy began to ram straight down towards the spire of Arabot.
Time left until the destruction of Heaven.
18 minutes 42 seconds.
‘no! As it is… … .’
Ikael looked at the sky with a blank expression.
The Valhalla Action moved Shirone to the entrance of Arabot in an instant, and the thickness of the laser fired from there was enough to pierce the sky.
If Shirone’s magic is true, heaven will perish.
‘How can I stop it?’
While she was concerned about the safety of Heaven, nothing mattered to Faiel, the archangel of annihilation.
It simply flew towards the place where Shirone was in order to remove the impurities in front of it.
Ikael knew that it was to kill Shirone.
However, no matter how much the original concept was extinction, it was questionable why Faiel was so reckless.
‘What is at the end of this war?’
In the message Faiel left behind, the true intentions of Ankera, who had banned the activities of angels and reinstated himself as the archangel, must have been hidden.
“Shirone… … .”
Faiel was already closing the distance with Shirone by more than half.
Since he had intended to kill her from the start, if left alone, Shirone would just disappear into nothingness.
“Keugh!”
As I thought about it, Ikael’s asteroid began to vibrate at a terrifying speed.
She made a resolution every time her mind was shaken, but she finally realized it in front of the reality of absolute death called Faiel.
The fact that something bigger than heaven might be nestled in lost memories.
Super Magical Amplification Ataraxia.
Ikael clenched his fists and inflated his halos.
Hey hey hey!
The spectacle of light striking a huge magic circle hundreds of meters in diameter is truly heavenly beauty.
She mobilized all available mental power to reveal the original concept, and poured that mighty amplifying power into a single thought.
‘I need to get my memory back!’
A piece of memory that Ankera erased.
What remained at the edge of the disconnected thought was only a small signal that could not even be called language, but Ataraxia amplified it more than 200 million times and filled the mind with a perfectly clear image.
“uh?”
As the only remaining image swept over his entire body, he began to repair the bluntly ripped off memories on his own.
The archangel’s thought advanced so fast that it could be called light, and finally, all thoughts were perfectly united into one history, as if a new highway was connected to a broken bridge.
“ah… … .”
Tears, clear as light, flowed down Ikael’s cheeks.
Aaaaaaaaaaaa!
The bitter cry of the noblest angel in the world shook Arabot.
‘How, how could I forget?’
A miserable feeling penetrated his chest like a dagger, and his mind spewed out like blood.
Shirone.
and guffins.
Compared to the life he has lived his whole life as the first angel and the head of all angels, the time he met them is only a moment.
But for Ikael, it was the most beautiful and brightest moment in her time.
Only that memory can exist.
So, if you lost that memory, you were the one who didn’t need to exist.
I never thought that the result of choosing for Shirone would eventually ruin everything like this.
‘Ra is… … .’
Where are you trying to lead the whole world?
“Shirone eh eh!”
Ikael suddenly came to his senses and spread his wings of light.
In exchange for regaining her memories, she had exhausted most of her mental strength, but she managed to squeeze a bit of power and fly to my Shirone.
When he looked down, Faiel had already arrived in front of Shirone and was gathering the energy of extinction in his hand.
“Are you running towards your own death? Well, that would be the limit of humans, the Nephilim.”
Shirone gritted his teeth and glared at Faiel.
It took 10 minutes to pay while changing the cause and effect with the Valhalla action.
The risk wouldn’t have been this great if only God’s Punishment was cast, but it took much longer than expected to move to the coordinates where you could hit Arabot’s Spire accurately.
‘No, it’s made with this.’
He could not save Peope, who had dedicated his entire life for him, and was almost killed by Ikael, whom he had expected to become a spiritual refuge for the rest of his life.
I thought that since I had completed my mission, it didn’t matter at all from now on.
‘Amy, I’m sorry. Everyone… … .’
Remembering the faces of the precious people she left behind in her hometown, Shirone waited for the coming death.
“Go away, insignificant being!”
The face made up of light and darkness hidden behind Faiel’s hood twisted grotesquely, and the darkness made of particles burned like a flame.
As the power of extinction raged and was about to swallow Shirone, Ikael caught up with Faiel by a narrow margin.
“No eh eh eh!”
Aaaaaaaaaagh!
When Ikael, who blocked Shirone’s way, activated his power, the concept of extinction and amplification collided and the whole area was shaken.
‘Ikael?’
Shirone looked up at Ikael’s face, who was two heads taller than her.
He wasn’t sweating, but his complexion was pale and his eyes were haggard.
Even so, Ikael tried to smile for Shirone, but soon that expression turned into sadness, apologetic, and sorrow that surpassed everything, conveying the sorrowful feelings as they were.
“I’m sorry.”
Ikael said everything that cannot be expressed in words with his eyes.
“sorry. Shirone… … .”
The moment she saw Ikael’s tears, the same tears flowed from Shirone’s eyes.
Possibly the same ingredient, a cozy feeling that makes you want to be lost in such an illusion forever begins to inject moisture into Shirone’s sensibilities that have dried up through the war.
“Shirone, you… … .”
Aaaaaaaaagh!
Before he could finish his words, Ikael’s body was thrown to the side.
After she disappeared, Shirone saw Faiel with an angry expression in her field of vision.
“This is Ikael. Fallen filthy archangel. How far will you go to destroy the existence of angels?”
Shirone tried her best to move her body, but there was no way to violate the principle of equivalent exchange.
“It won’t matter.”
Faiel turned his head to Shirone again.
“It’s enough when both ugliness and nobility disappear.”
When Faiel attacked Shirone again, Ikael, who fell to the ground, jumped up and blocked the way again.
“Keugh!”
It was the only thing she could do, having exhausted her strength in exchange for remembering Shirone.
But now, even Faiel didn’t care.
As if to overwhelm him with only power and concept, he poured his ability of extinction into Ikael in front of him.
As the dotted smoke of darkness enveloped Ikael, like a swarm of insects, her asteroid gradually began to lose its light.
“Huhhhhhh!”
I desperately tried to hold on, but Ikael’s expression clearly showed the shock of the angel’s presence being erased.
‘Ugh, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. Aaaaaa!’
Shirone shed tears as she looked at Ikael.
The feeling of having no choice but to watch someone you love die without being able to lift a finger or burst into tears was the final destination of the most miserable emotions that humans can feel.
“It’s okay, Shirone… … . are you okay.”
Ikael’s smile was beautiful.
It was the most beautiful smile in the universe.
* * *
Armin, Siena, and Kuan arrived in front of Ingris’ portal and waited for Ethella to arrive.
Zulu, who went to save the metagate, had to meet him separately outside, but he needed a disk to extract the coordinates from the Akashic Records.
“It is strangely late. I don’t know what happened.”
Ethella must also know that time is running out, so even if Ya-maeng had broken his promise or failed to keep the contract, it would have been normal if he had arrived at Jebul by now.
“Let’s wait a little longer. He’s a nice person, but he’s not so clumsy that he can’t make sense of things. I’ll be back soon.”
Siena still believed in Ethella, but a bad feeling was triggered in her head as well.
Bishop of the Karsis Monastery.
Heaven is definitely a place teeming with beings so powerful that you can’t even roam around comfortably with normal skills, but there’s no way you can’t do it, at least to the extent of avoiding a fight and carrying out your mission.
Even when Gaold first formed the team, it was proven that he prioritized Ethella over himself.
‘What the hell happened?’
As Siena’s thoughts began to creep in with anxiety, a muffled scream came from Ingris’ hallway.
“Kurrrrr!”
All three heads turned at the same time.
Just looking at the ferocious shape of the shadow that came out of the corner at first, I could tell that it was not a normal enemy.
“what?”
It was a creature they had never seen before.
But I would have felt the same way no matter who I brought to this place.
Garas, which has no clear species characteristics, expresses its appearance only through the biological characteristics of its mother, and the only fixed and unchanging traits are a protein arch and a tremendous desire to reproduce.
The shapes of the dark ones were different, perhaps because of this, but they all had their own unity because they were all subordinates of night blindness.
It was two meters tall, with dark skin covered in slime, long knees with reverse joints, and a twisting spine with a tail full of bumps at the end.
“Kikiki! It is breeding!”
Basically, because human traits were grafted, language was not a problem.
However, what was different from the kings of breeding who were born at the headquarters of Resis was that they were all strong men with telomere level 5 or higher.
The moment she saw Garas’ eyes, Siena got goosebumps.
It was completely different from living, but it was a terrifying fear that I couldn’t help but feel instinctively as a woman.
ice cloud.
A freezing haze rose around Siena.
The rapidly cooled air froze into ice crystals that splattered like glass dust on the floor.
The fact that the warlike Siena cast defense magic before even competing with each other could tell the extent of the shock she felt.
However, the fear was controlled by the sorcerer’s cool reason, and the will to fight burned in the eyes glaring at the evil lust.
‘Cheeky things.’
The person who sensed Garras’ disposition and felt the most displeased was Kuan.
He was already burning with vitality, and he gripped the handle of his sword stronger than usual.
“I’ll take it… … .”
The moment Kuan tried to block Siena’s way, Armin preoccupied the position first.
“Stand back. There is no need to drain your energy in a place like this.”
With Armin’s stop, any enemy can be blocked.
However, from Siena’s point of view, Armin’s overprotection against an enemy that was neither an angel nor a Mara was unpleasant.
If I had to add one thing to that, the gaze of Garas, who looked down on me, was annoying enough to make me nervous.
“I’m worried. Just this much… … !”
“Kiaaaaa!”
Dozens of Garas screamed.
The roar of hundreds of emotions mixed in a single sonic wave is an inherent characteristic that no creature can imitate.
The three people who were exposed to the desire that emotionally overwhelms humans were very tense.
The powerful vitality of telomere level 5 plus extreme desire added to the explosive movement of Garras.
ice dagger.
From Siena’s frozen cloud, ice knives that turned into daggers were scattered in all directions.
The magic cast by a certified 5th level wizard was fired without a break, and the approaching glass bounced off each one.
Ting! teeting!
As the Garras shrank their bodies, their uppers hardened and shattered the ice swords.
Although he is pushed back by the shock, he is not fatally injured.
Even Kuan’s sword was deflected by the resilience of chitin.
‘Damn it!’
It wasn’t as good as Ringer’s armor, but it was humiliating for a swordsman to have a mediocre creature block its own attack with its body.
Absolute Zero.
When Siena’s most powerful magic, Absolute Zero, was cast, the glass began to freeze one by one.
As Kuan’s sword took effect, fragments of frozen Garath flew in all directions.
in the middle of that open view.
A man was standing.

Chapter - 495 - That Afternoon (3).txt
===============================
[495] That afternoon (3)
“What is that again?”
Kuan was the first to show aggression and approached.
Although he was human, he was a man with a strange impression that seemed to fall short of the standard.
“I am… … What were you born to accomplish?”
His features were shabby and ugly, and the exposed skin from the neck down was covered with the chitin of Garras.
His fingers were pouty, as if they were wearing steel gloves, and thick, sharp hair grew like a porcupine.
Nephilim, nameless (unnamed), who was born by Adio, the angel of achievement.
From the moment he was born, the name was not important to him who came all the way to this place following the question in his heart that had been placed like a calling.
As Moo-myeong looked at the sword Kuan was holding, he opened his hands wide, and the light exploded in front of his palms, and before he knew it, two swords were lifted.
Kuan raised one eyebrow and looked at him displeasedly. Nameless raised his sword and said:
“What is the name of this object?”
It was strange that he implemented the sword without knowing what it was, but Kuan was honest.
“It is a sword.”
“It’s a sword. How do you write it?”
“If you ask me how I write… … .”
Kuan pulled out external gravity and threw himself.
“I’ll answer that it’s written like this.”
Kuan’s body, which had eaten the rapid rotation, swung the sword in front of the unknown like a top.
At that moment, the nameless realized.
The fact that that sword would sooner or later slit his own throat and drop his life.
bang!
A pair of nameless swords blocked the way, and Kuan’s sword struck above them.
Neither technique nor tactics, just defense to sustain life.
It was only thanks to the physical condition inherited from the angel and Karas that he was able to block the sword of the Kaizen Swords Academy instructor.
Sparks flew as the blade scratched the blade, and Nameless’ body was pushed back and crashed into the wall.
He managed to keep his balance and mumbled something with his head lowered, still not loosening his defenses.
Kuan felt rather strange at the bland response.
‘Don’t you know swordsmanship? Then what is it, the intense feeling of strangeness when I first saw it?’
After finishing his thoughts, the nameless head finally lifted.
“I get it.”
“what?”
Kuan grabbed his sword and strode away.
“What is a sword?”
The nameless figure disappeared from Kuan’s sight.
Since all the functions of the schema were Kuan focused on the movement, it could not happen just because it was fast.
Searching for traces of the missing enemy, Kuan’s pupils were fixed deep on the left.
kang! And the swords clashed again, but this time the situation was completely reversed.
‘Can’t you react?’
Is human thought really infinitely free?
It was a topic that never left Kuan’s mind from the moment he grabbed the sword.
And the conclusion he had reached while swinging his sword was clearly ‘not so’.
Human thinking seems free, but when a truly free being looks down, it is extremely mechanical and bound to patterns.
In order to overcome the limits of that thought, Kuan has been practicing movement throughout his life and has reached the present state.
But now, the unknown movement transcended even his thoughts.
‘Swordsmanship… … Did you know?’
Suddenly, such a question crossed his mind, but Kuan quickly changed his mind.
It’s not like I already knew it, but I’m growing as I clash swords.
‘No, this is indeed an evolutionary level.’
Explosive swordsmanship growth or enlightenment that could not be explained otherwise.
The nameless twin swords gradually began to wield in a trajectory that deviated from Kuan’s common sense, and inflicted fatal wounds on Kuan’s body in just five minutes.
“Keugh!”
Kuan, who had been cut in the chest, rotated to check the approach and retreated to the end of the hallway.
The humiliation as a swordsman hurt more than the wound in his chest.
If he were the first to pick up the sword today, he would have caught up with all the achievements Kuan had achieved in 30 years in just 5 minutes.
‘Is it possible?’
Nameless is a Nephilim who is a hybrid between the Angel of Achievement and Karas.
Through this deformed crossbreeding, which may be the first in the history of heaven, new traits were manifested in Nameless.
As the spirit of an angel pursuing a lofty spirit was combined with Garas, all transcendent desires for reproduction were converted into desires for achievement.
If Garas only pursued reproduction, what constituted the spirit of obscurity was only the understanding of technology and a deeper realm that transcended it.
Ignorance was breaking through at a tremendous speed the barriers that a human being would have to overcome over many years through ceaseless training.
I want to do better. I want to do better. I want to do better.
Like a hole that sucks in anything, the obscenity took Kuan’s 30-year swordsmanship intact and sublimated it to a higher level.
In the face of an attack whose realization was reflected in his swordsmanship, Kuan was only in a hurry to defend.
‘I can’t do this! It can’t be like this!’
He clenched his teeth and desperately endured, but the unknown swordsmanship was more tenaciously surpassing the limits of his ideas.
“We have to help!”
The moment Armin and Siena were about to cast a spell on Nameless, Kuan shouted with the momentary composure obtained by wringing out all kinds of hair.
“no! Run away!”
Only those who have personally fought can understand the fear of unknown.
However, it was after Armin and Siena had already taken action.
Armin cast flicker magic to distract the unnamed gaze, and Siena fired seven ice spears at the same time.
Thanks to this, Kuan was able to escape from the brink of death, but he knew that the cost would be many times greater.
Anonymous, who spread the distance to avoid the ice spear, immediately showed interest in the magicians’ skills.
“What is that?”
A high level of improvement far beyond human imagination hit the brain of an unknown person.
‘Would! Would! Would! Would!’
That colossal desire raised all of the functions of ignorance beyond their limits, and the Spirit Zone opened immediately.
Armin, who felt the unknown Spirit Zone with synesthesia, was on the verge of getting goosebumps.
It is not simply finding the focus of the mind.
‘I opened the Immortal Function.’
The unknown who cast the flicker magic went back to Armin and swung his sword.
In front of his ability to use the spirit zone and schema at the same time, Armin leaned back with a feeling that his hair stood on end.
When the sword missed, Nameless immediately cast magic and fired an ice spear at Siena.
Only then did Armin realize why Kuan couldn’t even use his hands and had to be pushed back.
‘damn! How can a creature like this!’
It is a foul.
No genius can instantly copy the magic of freezing used by a certified 5th grade wizard.
But it was just an emotional resentment, and in fact Armin knew it.
The fact that there is no such thing as cheating in this world.
If you have already been born that way, no matter what bizarreness it contains, it is just reality.
‘I can’t escape as long as I’ve mastered the flicker magic.’
Armin’s cold-hearted mind in front of a living creature he experienced for the first time in his life did not catch the standard of judgment.
The only possibility is to mobilize all forces right away to eliminate the nameless.
However, if the growth rate of obscurity exceeds his expectations, it was them who would rather be eaten.
Even so, it would be appropriate to choose the former, but in a situation where the risk of Siena was guaranteed with a high probability, the judgment would be different.
‘We have to save Siena. No matter what the cost of her, she has to return to her home as safe as she is.’
That was the only gift I could risk my life to give to my younger sister whom I had loved all my life.
Armin rolled on the floor hugging Siena, who was unable to even use his hands in front of an unknown, chaotic movement.
“Isn’t there anything more fun?”
The moment Nameless rushed in with his mad eyes raised, Armin realized what he had to do.
‘I’m sorry, Kuan.’
At the same time as the nameless sword drew an X, Armin put a stop magic barrier around Siena and himself.
“Huh!”
Moo-myeong hurriedly stopped the sword just before it was stopped.
It was an action that was absolutely impossible with normal inertia, and was only possible with the unknown realization of ignorance.
‘What is this?’
The unknown Spirit John immediately analyzed the abnormality of the stop magic and transmitted it to the brain.
Even if I had moved forward a little more, I would have been tied up in a place where time stopped.
Armin hugged Siena and looked at the nameless beyond the barrier with a nervous expression.
Since the inside of the station field was emptied, the two of them were free from the timeline, and they intended to take Siena and run away as soon as they saw the slightest opening in the unknown.
‘If you get to the stop… … .’
Just thinking about it is terrifying.
Maybe I should have died right here.
However, for Armin, who only Siena was everything, it was an option that he didn’t even have to choose from the beginning.
“Hmm, that’s it, right?”
Moo-myeong savored the stop’s force field for a while, then opened her eyes and cast magic.
As Armin and Siena watched with nervous expressions, Nameless’s head gently tilted to the side.
“what? can’t you?”
Armin’s heart, which had been beating like crazy, calmed down for a moment in a sigh of relief.
* * *
“Don’t think that this is over. Ra will never tolerate your existence… … Keugh!”
With a popping sound, another ordinary angel exploded with Satan’s hand holding its neck.
Equipped with the concept of Satan, Frank Wein found and dealt with the hidden angels one by one as if playing hide-and-seek, and as their number decreased, the seesaw of the law quickly tilted.
“It’s cool. I don’t even send a message with Pyeongangsa.”
Literally, the law beyond the law.
No matter how great the concept the angels are armed with, they cannot have any influence as much as Satan.
thud! thud!
Two echoes pierced the ceiling of the jebul and pierced the hallway where Frank Wine was.
“Hoo? How about this time?”
The corner of Frank Wein’s mouth went up at the appearance of the big man.
The archangels of combination and disintegration, Methiel and Satiel, each possessing the concept of the source of strong and weak power, have arrived.
“The insignificant rat who was hiding on the other side of the law is running rampant without knowing how scary the world is.”
Methiel walked away with a cold gaze.
Realizing that Metatron had disappeared by looking down, the two archangels immediately flew to Jebul.
In order to balance the seesaw of the law, it would be best for them to avoid it, but at present, all the ordinary angels in Jebul are in hiding according to the order of Ra.
If the number of ordinary angels decreased even further here, even if all the archangels gathered, they could not guarantee a victory, so they chose to settle as quickly as possible.
“Do you really think so, Archangel? It’s not me who fears, isn’t it Ra of the law?”
“Don’t talk like a mongrel whose concept is unclear, pretending to be noble. I am very offended.”
As Methiel slowly raised his hand, Satiel, who was standing next to her, also spread her halo.
Metatron’s gravitational force is a pure expression of the original concept.
Therefore, it is highly likely that Satan, who is powerful but invincible to the law, worked rather favorably.
However, Methiel and Satiel are different.
When the two archangels are combined, there is plenty of room for secondary applications as they can freely handle all the particles in the world.
“It’s fun to see pretty girls doing aegyo.”
At Satan’s provocation, Methiel and Satiel flew at the same time.
As the strong and weak forces were combined, the objects melted like paint, and the scenery of the Buddhist memorial service changed into something completely different that could not exist in this world.
Bizarre substances that were not even named were manifested with extraordinary characteristics, and bizarre phenomena that could never be imagined by the intellect began to occur around Satan.
In a landscape like an abstract painting painted by a madman, two archangels unleashed a terrifying attack on Satan.
Radiation blasted out and harassed Satan’s cells, and the atmosphere, which produced super-high heat just by touching it, burned Satan’s entire body.
“Great!”
Particles that distort time restrain Satan’s hands and feet, and metal that distorts space molded his body into clay.
“Let’s finish with this.”
At Methiel’s words, Satiel nodded and rushed.
Normally, the two angels are like rivals, but in battle, there would be no other partner in Heaven that would be such a good match.

===============================
[496] That afternoon (4)
“Ha ha ha ha ha!”
Laughter erupted from the mass of Satan, which was crushed into a collapsed form and whose eyes, nose, mouth, and limbs were tangled together.
A powerful shock wave rippled the atmosphere and spread, and in an instant Satan’s body returned to its original state.
“this… … !”
Satan’s two mighty grips gripped the angels’ necks.
The faces of the two similarly beautiful angels contorted in the same way at the power that seemed to break their necks at any moment.
‘Did he lean this far?’
The durability of an angel’s body is not so weak that it can destroy any creature carelessly.
Also, the secondary application of the laws they used was obviously effective.
However, Satan’s law, which destroyed countless ordinary angels and erased even the archangel Metatron, was much stronger than Methiel and Satiel expected.
If the Akashic Records are everything in the universe, Satan’s law is another everything that is symmetrical to it.
In other words, if the seesaw of the law is in a state of balance to some extent, apart from the concept, even the physical shock cannot be fully transmitted.
“Two archangels.”
Satan looked alternately at the two tormented archangels and smiled wickedly.
“Is this enough?”
Just as the starlight bodies of the strangled Methiel and Satiel shook as if they were about to explode, someone rushed from behind Satan and delivered a blow.
The strength was rapidly drained from Satan’s flinching body, and Methiel and Satiel escaped.
However, the angels who had already been broken did not come into Satan’s eyes.
“whoever… … ?”
The shock itself wasn’t that big, but I felt something enough to temporarily neutralize Satan’s law.
Satan looked back and finally realized the reason.
Bishop Ethella of the Order of Karsis, the bearer of the law of perfect goodness, was glaring at Satan with burning eyes.
* * *
‘Just a little further… … .’
Flew’s vision caught a glimpse of the walls of Arabot.
However, it quickly disappeared like a utopia, and giants filled the place.
“Black! Whoops!”
Sad tears poured down.
As a professional wizard, she came to heaven with pride, but it was too daunting and difficult for her to do anything.
Matei’s giant guards were so huge that her magic couldn’t even send a message to the liver.
What can I do in a place like this?
The reason I keep running is because if I stop here, I won’t be able to do anything forever.
I felt that even the self-esteem of a wizard that I had protected all my life would collapse.
‘I can still, still fight more!’
thud! thud! thud! thud!
The giants spotted the fleurs running beneath their feet and slammed them down.
Flew, who was rolling on the ground, bit her lips in misery, as if she had turned into an insect.
A mighty voice was heard from the sky.
“This is why humans are annoying. They are weak and even small.”
The giant, annoyed at the sight of Fleur stubbornly avoiding it, slammed the greatsword down with all his might.
Aaaaaaaang!
For Flew, it was a world-shattering shock.
Debris the size of a house flew in all directions, and the shock wave pushed Flew’s body dozens of meters away.
While Floo, whose back was stuck on the raised ground like a stalactite, lost concentration for a moment, a rock the size of a person’s head flew in and hit his shoulder.
“Aaaaaagh!”
The sound of bones crunching through his body made Fleur sense that it was all over.
He fell to the floor screaming, but his right shoulder was completely shattered and he couldn’t even roll over.
Seeing the giant’s palm descend from the sky, Flew shuddered as if electrocuted.
Just as a child can think of hundreds of ways to annoy an ant, he had no idea how he would be killed by a giant.
“Flu!”
He didn’t even have time to look back at the place where the voice came from, someone ran up to Flew and threw him into a hug.
“Aaaaaaagh!”
Clutching his aching shoulder and screaming, Flew’s eyes widened when he saw the face of the man who had saved him.
“How are you here?”
Why is Crude, who should have been commanding the rebels in the middle of the battlefield, come here alone?
Besides, it’s not a titan or a guroi, but only equipped with a piper, a mecha tier 1 weapon.
“Why are you here? What about the rebels?”
“The war is over. We lost.”
“What nonsense!”
Even if you lose, if you’re a commander, shouldn’t you fight to the end?
But Flew soon shut up.
She had no right to point out Crude to Arabot, who informed her that God’s punishment had been placed on her.
‘They must be resentful.’
I know that Crude couldn’t tell the truth to the rebels until the very end.
He said he didn’t care, but what he must have felt was not something Flew could have imagined.
That’s why Crude came.
‘It’s better If my death makes you feel better… … .’
“but.”
Crude, who measured the high walls of Arabot, continued.
“Now that this is the case, wouldn’t it be better to see the kingdom of heaven perish?”
While Fleur was speechless at the words that were completely different from what he expected, Crude carried her and ran toward the castle wall.
Taking full advantage of Piper’s ability to zigzag, the giants slammed the ground with their soles and began to hunt insects.
Every time the giant’s foot fell, the ground shook like a rubber sheet, and the roar alone made the eardrums numb.
‘I can do it.’
Even in the distant fear that seemed to be out of this world, Crude desperately held on to reason.
He was the one who boarded the Kuroi while equipped with the Piper, and then manipulated the titan, a gigantic equipment, with precision down to a millimeter error.
Even if he couldn’t be compared to the power of a giant, his understanding of the equipment that he was called a genius pilot was comparable to that of an eternal person.
“People who are not even worms!”
However, as the tempo of the giants’ foot painting increased, there was a limit to the scale that could not be overcome with skill alone.
Even if you run a hundred steps, you are within one step of a giant.
Even coming here with a flue in such a situation was a miracle.
“excuse me! Arabot!”
Crude was also watching where Fleur was shouting.
However, if you climb the wall with the straight-up method, you will only be caught and crushed by the giant’s hand.
“Do you know why I came to you?”
It was an out of the blue question in a desperate situation, but strangely, Flew felt convinced.
It didn’t make sense to her that she had come to save herself, whom she thought was the most resentful person in the world.
“To kill me… … .”
At Fleur’s candid answer, Crude pondered and smiled as if he had made up his mind.
“Be sure to come back alive.”
“What are you saying now… … .”
Haven’t heard an answer yet.
But before Flew could ask again, Crude pulled out Piper’s voice recognition device and spat out a command.
“Release the limit.”
Chunk! Chunk!
Piper reads the user’s movement fast enough to match the nerve speed and increases muscle strength.
However, no matter how much the function is improved, the limit that the human body can endure is clear.
That’s why Piper, who lifted the limit, could no longer be called a strength-assisting device.
some kind of trap.
It was a killing machine that restrained and destroyed the human body.
‘It should be done with the maximum output.’
Crud knew better than anyone else that this was his last chance.
As he twisted his waist while pulling the flue out between his sides, Piper, sensing the user’s motion, spun at full power.
Deed Dede Deuk!
As the waist rotated half a turn, the sound of Crud’s vertebrae being crushed was heard.
“Great!”
Crude didn’t care.
He only struggled to get the strength to swing his twisted back once more and send Flew over the ramparts.
“Aaaaaaa!”
The small engine roared, and Crude’s waist returned to its original position at great speed.
As the discs were crushed, a stunner sent to his brain, and Flew’s body slashed through the air like a cannonball.
“Catch it!”
The giants held out their hands towards Fleur as they flew past Crude.
It was flying at a tremendous speed, but the huge hand reached out toward the pluo, overwhelming the scale of space.
The palms that blocked the view were pressed into Flew’s eyes, and at the same time, five fingers closed.
Dawkins Algorithm.
Flew slipped through the fingers and hurriedly cast a fly magic and landed on the walls of Arabot.
Flew looked at Crud, who had been left far away, in a feeling of fear, with no time to feel the relief of having lived.
“Oh, no… … .”
When he thought that he was probably smiling, the giant who belatedly followed grabbed Crude.
The giant bent at the waist as if about to collapse sped up, straightened his upper body, and expressed his anger at missing the flue with a scream.
“Gaaaaaaaagh!”
If she jumps into Arabot, the sacred ground of Ankera, the giant will no longer be able to catch her.
So, the last remaining possibility was a human slinging at Flew, who was still on the wall.
As the giant swung his arm at Fleur, Crude’s body flew straight ahead.
bang!
Crude’s body, which was barely able to hit the flue, spun and bounced at the same time as it crashed into the corner of the castle wall.
“no… … .”
Flew looked at Crude, stunned.
The first thing I thought of when I saw the bizarrely twisted limbs that I could never think of as human beings was a selfish question.
‘I mean I haven’t heard of it yet.’
Crude’s body, which was spinning around in the air, went over the wall following the inertia of the throw and fell to the ground in Arabot.
“No eh eh eh!”
Unable to hold back the heat, Fleur jumped down the wall following Crude.
* * *
Kang! Kang!
The iron, which boasts the highest rigidity, began to crack.
The sword of the giant corps leader Girshin, who had reached the 7th level of Anecdotal Art, finally began to destroy Babel’s body.
Kanya trembled as she held the stunned Lena in her arms.
The battle between Girshin and Babel was so fast that her eyes, an ordinary Mecha member, could not follow it, but it was so fast that she could accurately imagine it just by looking at the roaring fireworks.
The other giants had already annihilated all the rebels and left to push the rearguard forward, and only Kanya and Lena were the only survivors left on the desolate battlefield.
“no. this is not… … .”
The reason why everyone died and only them survived.
It’s a fact she never wants to think about, but Kanya had a duty to know it.
Babel, who calculated the odds of war as 0%, moved only to protect Kanya and Lena.
And now… … Even the probability of the third item of Shirone’s algorithm was converging to 0%.
“Hehe, that’s pretty good for a tin can. But that’s the limit of the machine. No one can overcome the might of a giant.”
To Girshin, Babel was a match he hadn’t met in a long time, but the inspiration was just there.
He has always won, so no one is worth more than a match.
There is only one being who can rule him.
Not even Anker, but the strongest of all creatures in this world, the giant Ymir.
“Tahaaaaa!”
Girshin’s spirit was completely buried in the ensuing roar, and Babel’s right arm was cut off with a flash of light.
Losing part of a body organ in Babel’s program, which specializes in bactu, is a fatal blow.
That’s why the Gaians also considered durability as the most important thing when designing a barbell.
However, Girshin’s strength surpassed its durability, and finally Babel’s arithmetic device produced a win rate of less than 0.1%.
Avoiding Girshin’s sword, Babel threw herself and blocked Kanya and Lena’s path.
thud! thump thump!
As her shoulders opened, the protruding ironclad slammed into the ground, protecting Kanya and Lena.
Almost at the same time, Girshin ran and struck Babel with his sword.
Aaaaaaaaaagh!
As a tremendous shock exploded on Babel’s back, Kanya’s shoulders, who had been listening closely, shook.
But Babel’s expression didn’t change at all.
He was still enduring Girshin’s attack while looking indifferently at Kanya and Lena with a cold face like a machine.

[497] That afternoon (5)
“do … ”
Kanya spit out involuntarily.
“Run away.”
Babel didn’t answer.
Due to the priority of the Syrone Algorithm, it was an order that could not be followed.
But to Kanya, algorithms didn’t matter anymore.
It is because the face of the most important person who had to leave a year ago overlaps with the appearance of Babel who protects her and Lena.
‘mom… … .’
Babel is not a mother.
Because they are not living things, they do not feel pain, and because they do not have life, they have no fear of death.
It was completely different from the mother who willingly accepted death for the sake of her children without expressing her pain.
“Run away! I don’t want to be helped by the likes of you!”
But why are the tears flowing?
My father’s death is still clearly imprinted in my head, so why does my heart hurt so much?
“Babel protects Kanya and Lena.”
The vibrations of her torso bursting and cracking mixed with noise in her audio system.
“You are the enemy! You killed my dad! you killed my dad! You are not my mother!”
“Babel pays a price when the war is over.”
“no! I mean no!”
Kanya hugged Babel and cried.
The thought that there was still someone protecting him was so unfair and resentful, but a sense of regret flooded over him, wondering why he hadn’t realized it a little earlier.
As Girshin’s attack became stronger, Babel’s aircraft began to shake more violently.
The red panels embedded in Babel’s eyes flickered, and machine fragments resembling human flesh spurted out like a fountain behind him.
It is dying.
Clearly, Kanya felt that way about Babel’s condition.
“What if I leave like this! you will kill me! I will kill you in the most painful way!”
Machines don’t die.
only disintegrates.
Babel decided that the information should be passed on, but erased the sentence immediately before output.
“I feel no pain. but… … ,”
Kanya, covered in tears and snot, looked up.
For the first time, a clear voice with noise removed leaked from Babel’s still cold face.
“Maybe this is the pain.”
“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa”
A crushing sadness weighed on Kanya’s heart.
“I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you until the end.”
As the red panels of the Babel burned brilliantly, Kanya shook her head like a child and shouted.
“no! don’t do it! It’s an order! according to my instructions! I mean don’t do it!”
Given an impossible order, Babel searched for answers for a while, but there was no option to stop her tears.
Perhaps it was an illusion, but Kanya thought that Babel had a slightly troubled smile on his lips.
– Execute self-destruct mode. Map weapon Babel.
Babel, who had risked everything with a probability of less than 0.1 percent and endured destruction so far, raised its output to the maximum.
“Oohhhh!”
As Girsin glared at the shattered back of Babel and struck the final blow, a flash of light was fired from the glass sphere that served as the muzzle for the map weapon.
“this… … !”
As the glass sphere shattered, the photoelectric cannon spread carelessly.
A flash of light devastated the area around the rear radius, and there was nothing left where it passed.
-Target removal failed.
After accepting the final signal from the central device, Babel tried every possible way to restart the machine, but there was nothing he could do as it was horribly destroyed.
‘Cane… … .’
As soon as a short name was entered into the computing device, the power to all devices was cut off, and eternal darkness came.
“no! wake up! I can’t die! I mean get up again!”
Kanya hugged the upper body of the barbell and sobbed. He missed the most hated machine in the world.
* * *
Babel’s photoelectric cannon devastated a 2km radius to the rear.
It was such a speed of reaction, great power, and range that even Girshin of the world could not be sure of life or death.
However, since it was only a family, his expression was not good as he stood on a plateau 3 kilometers away from the battlefield.
The moment Babel’s muzzle caught the light, about 100 glass plates around him flashed and moved the space.
signal.
All giants know the power of Ikael’s triangular Mara and Ashur.
‘Ashur. Ymir’s rival.’
Girshin glared at Ashur with a kind eye.
It is now a thing of the past to compete for the position of the best commander in heaven, but Ashur was still a thorn in the eye for Ymir, who thought he was the best.
“I don’t say thank you. I could have avoided that kind of surprise.”
Even if he was second in the ranks of the giants, if the opponent was the archangel’s triangular Mara, he would not be in a position to stand up for himself, but Ashur didn’t care.
If pride had been important to him, he would not have evacuated Girshin in the first place.
“Don’t underestimate Babel’s computational power. It was unpredictable. Would you admit it too?”
“Heh, like that or not. If you die, you die. Running away is not to the taste of giants.”
“no. Further battles are pointless. All we can do is minimize power loss for the next war.”
Girshin frowned and asked.
“What nonsense are you talking about? Victory is just around the corner.”
“You still don’t know, what lies at the end of this war?”
“We only fight. The outcome is irrelevant.”
“Then let me tell you this. Why is Ymir still not moving?”
Girshin was silent.
Ymir’s animalistic intuition has already reached a level so transcendent that it cannot even be called the realm of animals.
“this… … Isn’t it the end?”
Ashur nodded.
“Currently, Satan has descended on Jebul and is destroying the angels. The human side cast a powerful magic that aimed directly at Arabot. Whichever comes first, at this rate Heaven will perish.”
Girshin’s expression began to grow serious.
“But Captain Ymir is not moving. thus… … .”
“okay.”
Realizing that no further explanation was necessary, Ashur cut off his words and concluded.
“The will of Ra will be activated soon.”

Second thousand Rakia.
Gangnan, whose wrists were tied, was standing with his legs half undone in the Hall of Corruption object <Jachung>.
<Jachung>’s ability is limited to absorbing power, but it was fixed in space using henna, an angel’s ability.
Kang Nan, who had been tortured all night, was horrendous, and his strength was so weak that he couldn’t even control himself.
The biggest problem was the eyes that lost their vitality.
Gaold does not come.
It was more understanding than resentment.
I was convinced that I could do it because I watched how intensely Gaold lived to save Miro.
“It is past noon. It seems to have abandoned you.”
Yuriel, who was floating with her arms folded outside the castle wall, looked over the destroyed bridge and said.
Gangnan did not answer.
I already knew it, but admitting it with my mouth was a completely different matter.
Uriel slowly turned around and looked back at Kariel standing next to Kang Nan.
‘I’m more weak than before.’
An angel’s greatness comes from the mind, so trauma directly affects their sense of presence.
Although Rayel canceled the stop magic, the humiliation suffered by humans further hurt Kariel, who was already weak.
Dark shadows fell under her eyes, and her handsome face was parched, devoid of any Archangel’s authority.
Whoa oh oh!
A gale blew in from Arrabot.
Just the sand mixed with the wind hitting the backboard made Gangnan feel the pain of burning his skin.
‘Life is… … pain.’
I said so.
Gaold.
“Kariel-sama, let the execution begin.”
The fallen angel Mauriel approached and asked for permission, but Kariel was still silent.
After being subjected to human magic, his hatred for humans deepened in his weakened mind.
The question was, what was the source of that hatred?
‘I am… … .’
When did you start hating humans?
The doubt that Kariel had never thought about met exactly at the point of contact with the question that Uriel had always thought about.
‘Yes, Kariel. Isn’t it strange indeed? Angels are great, but humans are confused. Indeed we… … .’
Are they really superior to humans?
There is no future of Heaven without an answer to that question.
That’s why Yuriel decided to watch Kariel’s long fight to the end, and it finally came to fruition.
“He is coming.”
All the remaining fallen angels and Maras in Rakia turned their heads to the plain in front of the wall.
Mikea Gaold, who had made them realize the terrible desires of humans, was moving slowly.
“Uh, why… … ?”
Kang Nan looked at Gaold with a shocked expression. It was an unbelievable sight even after seeing it with my own eyes.
When Uriel landed on the ground, Gaold stopped walking.
“Where is the maze?”
“… … .”
Gaold didn’t answer and looked up at Gangnan.
She was carrying all her weight with her hands in handcuffs, her clothes were torn and there were numerous scars.
Gaold, who had been looking at her for a long time with an expressionless face, suddenly opened his mouth and smiled coolly.
“Quack. You got it right, mutt.”
“This… … !”
Gangnan, who gritted his teeth and squeezed his strength, shouted.
“You fool! Why the hell did you come here!”
It was an honest feeling of gangnan.
It’s a maze that’s been recovered, but it’s time to run only for her, so what am I supposed to do when I give up everything and come here?
“Seeing how rough your mouth is, it looks like you can still hold on.”
“go back! I mean go to the maze! Have you forgotten what it cost you to come here?”
“Yeah, I forgot.”
“… … what?”
Kang Nan was at a loss for words at the words he uttered so easily and put on a dazed expression.
“I forgot what price you paid to save me until now.”
Kang Nan, who had tears in his eyes, desperately held back the cry that was about to vomit.
Did you know?
I’ve never talked about it, and I’ve never wanted him to know.
Therefore, Gangnan could be satisfied with this.
“okay. so go back Because I’m fine… … Because please… … Go find happiness.”
Gaold took another step.
As the distance with Uriel got closer, all the fallen angels flew in and surrounded Gaold.
Gaold, forced to stop again, looked up at Gangnan and raised a corner of his mouth.
“Don’t be too angry. Even if you don’t notice, I’ll leave on my own. But before that, shouldn’t we keep our promise?”
Gangnan’s lips trembled.
‘no. Do not say.’
“I said I would never leave you again.”
My heart started beating wildly.
A benevolent smile, rarely seen on Gaold, conveyed a feeling of extreme unease.
Gaold did not abandon the maze, nor did he come to save himself.
I was thinking of getting rid of all the hatred I had built up towards the world through 20 years of suffering.
Mauryel approached with a sneer.
“I must have told you to bring Miro. Do you think you can go back alive even if you violate the offer?”
“Ha, this guy and that guy… … .”
Gaold bowed his head and sighed softly.
And when he raised his head again, the good face disappeared before he knew it, and he was back to the mad wizard again.
“I’m going to get annoyed and go crazy.”
As the forgotten nightmare from 10 years ago resurfaced in his head, the blood drained from Gangnan’s face.
“don’t do it… … .”
Gaold’s eyelids trembled as he stared up at the sky, and his pupils slowly began to roll up.
“Don’t do it… … .”
Tears poured out uncontrollably, and Kang Nan could not stand it and wept bitterly.
“do not do that… … mister.”
At the same time, all of Gaold’s hair stood on end.
‘Goodbye, damn world.’
Dipper!
All the fallen angels surrounding Gaold disappeared as if they had evaporated, leaving only a few drops of liquid behind.

100 million times.

[498] Despair. despair (1)
life pain.
Gaold said so.
“mister.”
It was a time when Gaold, who had returned to Tormia, was struggling to raise the ranks of the association.
Gangnan, a 16-year-old girl who was walking in the association’s garden, plucked a red flower that grew next to the railing and showed it to Gaold.
“Isn’t this pretty?”
It was a splendid flower that could not be seen even in the southern part of her hometown, let alone in the desert where not a single blade of grass grows.
Gaold peered at the flowers with nonchalant eyes.
His magic skills were among the best in his age group, but politics was an area that required another talent.
He was gradually getting tired of the conflict within the association, and he was indifferent to everything.
Kang Nan also understood Gaold, so he did not wait for an answer and said, holding a petal in front of his eyes.
“What I like most about Tormia is that there are many pretty flowers. What is the name of this flower?”
“pain.”
Gangnan raised his eyes toward Gaold.
“pain? What is the name of this flower?”
“I don’t even know the name. But whatever the name, it is pain.”
Gaold strode forward and looked down at Gangnan.
Although he had become nervous lately, he had a colder and more fearful expression today.
“But these flowers are beautiful.”
Gaold snatched the flower Kangnan was holding.
“Strength, all living things can feel the world only through pain. Pleasure is actually just a way of accepting pain.”
“Daddy, you seem to be having a hard time these days. You better get some rest.”
Kang Nan expressed his sadness around the corner.
Of course, she now knows better than anyone how much Gaold must suffer and live in the world.
However, since Gaold had never expressed his misfortune, he didn’t want to see him say such a thing.
Gaold cast a spell and sharpened the tip of the flower.
“The reason why flowers are beautiful is to pass on to posterity, but from the time they are born until they wither, they never know who their mate is. You can’t even see what your child looks like. Kang Nan-ah, life is suffering. The five senses that make up us and the nerves that run under our skin are just functions designed to accept the pain of life.”
“Life is… … pain.”
It wasn’t a way of thinking that he liked, but Kang Nan thought that maybe Gaold’s words were true.
There is only a difference in degree, but this world that one existence accepts is full of suffering.
Pain 100 million times – air press.
Perseok!
All the fallen angels surrounding Gaold disappeared as if they had evaporated, leaving only a few drops of liquid behind.
It feels as if the sky has collided with the ground.
Among those within Gaold’s radius, Archangel Uriel was the only one who stood still.
Uriel’s halo spread out into a ring with a diameter of 100 meters and spun terrifyingly.
He didn’t appear to be shaken by the shock, but just by looking at how quickly his mind was accelerating, you could tell how powerful Gaold was.
‘Is this really human power?’
When it comes to a human being who transcends humans, Uriel only picks Mirage, but Gaold’s self-denial also had to be seen as having already surpassed the human category.
“Quaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
But that wasn’t what Gaold originally had.
After 20 years of hatred exploded all at once, the aftermath was enormous.
All I feel is pain.
Gaold, trembling as he lifted his egg white, lost his temper and screamed. Eventually, his lower jaw fell out and he began to emit sounds only through his throat.
“Aaaaaa! Aaaaaaa!”
Gaold ran madly.
Almost instinctively, running in the direction suggested by the realm of unconsciousness, he rushed toward the hardship.
puck!
As the second air press unfolded, the fallen angels and maras disappeared at the same time as the first.
“Ahhh! Khehehe!”
life pain.
Gaold felt 100 million times the pain, just by being there, all the information in the world was transmitted as pain.
Tears of blood flowed from Gaold’s eyes as he raised his head toward the sky, in shock too great for a human being made of flesh and blood to handle.
As if the soul imprisoned in the body is mad to escape the miserable creature’s prison.
Like that, Gaold struggled in the bondage of pain bestowed on creatures.

Tormia Kingdom.
Isabel, a certified third-class wizard and former manager of the magic library of the Magic Association, was hospitalized in a hospital dedicated to the association, one kilometer away from the Magic Association in Baska, the capital.
Although she was a talented scholar and magician recognized by the world, she was caught up in a political conspiracy within the Society and tortured for 48 hours for protecting Gaold.
As promised, Sakiri, the advisor, did not use the ‘balance of truth’ outside the rules.
However, the inside of his hands was cruel enough to feel even malice beyond the lack of emotion, and Isabelle painted all the time she was given in the color of pain without feeling even a second of comfort.
As a result, Isabelle endured 48 hours and bought time for Gaold’s team to go to heaven.
It was dawn yesterday that she had been unable to regain consciousness for over a month and depended on the life support system to continue her lifespan.
Healing wizards and surgeons checked her condition and asked many questions, but her mouth still remained unopened to this day.
He just blinked indifferently and looked up at the ceiling decorated with white wallpaper.
smart.
Even when someone knocked on the hospital room, her gaze did not return.
However, the moment I heard the voice of the man who opened the door and came in, my pupils shook and my head moved slowly.
“Are you okay? They say you woke up yesterday morning.”
Sakiri, a 5th-class magician certified by the Magic Association who tortured Isabelle for 48 hours, entered with a calm expression.
Isabel’s heart rate began to speed up exponentially as the memory of that time came to mind.
However, the shaking of the pupils soon subsided, and the expression also began to stabilize to some extent.
He is a man I never want to see again in my life.
However, Isabelle did not stop Sakiri from approaching.
What he wanted to gain by paying the price of giving up his body was the answer to Gaold’s long-standing question.
“How did it go?”
Sakiri brought a chair next to Isabelle’s bed and asked as she slowly sat down.
“What?”
“Gaold… … Did you go to heaven?”
“Went. But still haven’t come back. It may never come back.”
Sakiri sighed and looked at Isabelle, who was lost in thought, as she continued.
“The Association dispatched Cage Team B, but they are also out of contact. Things are getting complicated.”
Isabel couldn’t hear Sakiri’s words.
That wasn’t what she really wanted to know.
“… … Could it have transcended?”
Sakiri didn’t answer.
“Gaold… … .”
She clenched her right hand tightly, and she shuddered in shame and misery.
Amid all the tortures, Isabelle cursed being born a thousand times.
It was broken.
The feeling of falling endlessly towards something subhuman.
I felt like I could do anything mean, shameful, dirty and ugly if I could stop this pain.
That is the fate of living things.
The karma of human beings who have no choice but to be dominated by pain.
‘But how… … Gaold, how are you… … .’
Isabelle covered her eyes with her arms clenched into fists. Tears streamed down her cheeks incessantly between her eyelids.
“Gaold… … .”
Isabelle burst into tears and shouted.
“Did he really transcend! Could it have transcended pain, human bondage, and the fate of living things!”
If life is suffering, being born is a curse.
But if it was Gaold, maybe he could transcend that curse and become something truly free from pain?
If so, Isabelle can hold on.
Regardless of your will, you can overcome the hatred for humans that has been embedded in your brain and live again.
Sakiri answered honestly, embodying her experience as a torturer who tortured countless people.
“well. You can forget the pain. However, jumping over is impossible at the stage of living things.”
Turning his head to the window, he continued talking while looking farther than the sky.
“But if there was a case, it would be the only Gaold in the world.”
* * *
Perseok!
As the third Air Press was cast, the number of Fallen Angels and Mara decreased to about half of the first.
Now the enemies are beginning to realize the overwhelming force that has no choice but to disappear at the same time as they approach.
“Aaaaaaaaa!”
Gaold, who had become an incarnation of pain with no direction or purpose set, now forgot even the existence of Gangnan, who was chained to the wall, and ran wild without permission.
The appearance of Gaold with his lower jaw protruding, arms struggling, and bloody tears pouring out is like a goblin.
“mister… … ! mister… … !”
Like the girl who sent Gaold to Hell ten years ago, Kang Nan was terrified.
Life is not pain.
Gaold’s true face was not like that.
“Then why do we exist?”
As Gaold raised another topic as he walked to the flower bed, Kang Nando put aside thoughts of pain and roused his mind.
“It’s really strange. Humans experience pain from birth and must feel that pain until the moment they die. Then, is life just an illegitimate child with the curse of the universe?”
While Gangnan thought of an answer, Gaold walked over to the flower bed, scooped up the soil, and replanted the flowers.
“Can it survive, without roots?”
“Maybe it will take root again. Of course, you will have to go through a very painful process.”
Gaold looked back at Kang Nan who had approached the flower bed.
“But Kangnan, that is what life is like. Because you were born, flowers bloom even in pain.”
Gaold looked at the flower struggling for life with a hearty smile, then turned to Gangnan.
“So life is the most beautiful flower in the world. Just like this flower, our lives are also beautiful.”
Gangnan saw it for the first time.
Gaold’s face, with such a kind and beautiful smile, was the true face of Gaold before he became a madman.
“Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaaa!”
Gaold cried out.
His tongue was pulled out and his face, distorted like a demon, seemed to contain nothing but pain.
Watching Gaold writhe in pain, Gangnan closed his eyes tightly and burst into tears.
“Ahhh… … ! Ah ah ah ah ah… … !”
Gaold had to live with a disease called self-reciprocal mutation, possibly a curse from God.
But he said life is a beautiful thing.
The man I loved the most in the world, the man who was more beautiful than anything else, was crumbling.
‘Get loose! Please let go!’
Kang Nan struggled to get out of the <jachung> that restrained both hands.
“Get loose! It’s going to be loose!”
He didn’t mind breaking his arm and shook it, but because the power was absorbed, there was no impact.
‘I can’t send it like this!’
Even if your body is broken, you must go down. Jump down the wall and meet Gaold.
“Ahhh! Khehehe!”
Every time Gaold screamed in pain, Kang Nan’s heart was torn into a thousand pieces.
“mister! I’ll go! Hang in there!”
Kang Nan burst into tears and struggled even more, but <Jachung> didn’t think to open it at all.
In the helplessness of her entire life collapsing, she let out a miserable scream as she was clinging to the handcuffs.
“Ah ah ah ah ah! Ah ah ah ah ah!”
The feeling of having to watch the pain of a loved one is infinite pain that cannot be expressed in words.
Gangnan was finally able to understand Zulu’s words.
“Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa!”
The human heart is hell.

Tier 2 monster Furaka.
A giant reptile with three heads, it was the strongest monster that spewed flame, deadly poison, and electricity from each horn.
As a monster that boasts the most powerful attack magic among Zulu’s summoning magic, Puraka did not shrink even against the triangular Marakali.
A haze of deadly poison spread, and the white light of lightning flashed in a place full of colors of flame.
Every time the scenery glowed, Kali’s black shadow-like body revealed a wallpaper-like pattern.
The pattern resembling a whirlpool absorbed Puraka’s magic and discharged it as black smoke.
It was the spirit of death.
“You’re stupid, human.”
Kali swung her sword of death, knocking off Puraka’s three heads at the same time and charging at Zulu.
The four major weapons of Kali, the sword, shield, whip, and skull, each symbolize death, and their effects are cutting, disease, pain, and decay, and none of them are fatal to humans.
“I will take your life.”
Kali’s whip wrapped around Zulu’s wrist, excruciating pain.
The disappearance of Puraka’s body means that the boss is broken.
But Zulu’s expression did not change.
she reveals nothing
This is because expression is a form of communication that is possible only when there is someone to watch over.
Carly frowned at Zulu’s unconcerned appearance even in the state of being entangled in the whip of pain.
“You are a worthless human being.”
It’s not about putting up with it or not showing it.
It was strange, as if there was an abyss hole in her heart and all emotions were sucked into it.
“Anyway, death comes.”
Kali, with a skull in front, charged forward brandishing her sword and shield.
As the aura of disease deteriorated Zulu’s body and the aura of decay rotted his cells, the black sword drew a strange trajectory and aimed at Zulu’s neck.
Posmetry.
A golden space-time bird soared to the ceiling, a blade slicing straight through Zulu’s neck.
Zulu escaped from the whip wrapped around her wrist and retreated to the end of the trailer.
It is impossible for normal humans to concentrate their minds while being entangled in the whip of pain.
Kali had second thoughts about the Zulu man.
‘He’s severely deficient.’
absolute denial.
deny the pain
deny death
They are even denying themselves.
Standing at the center of the cycle, there is no clear reality for her, so even the pain is not real.
It was the complete opposite of Gaold’s self-denial, and therefore inhuman.
side side side side side side.
The only perceptible change in Zulu’s gaze at Carly was the progressively faster sucking sound.
“I’m sorry, human. How did you get to that point?”
‘I can’t win at this rate.’
Faiel’s triangular mara is the nemesis of all living things.
‘Should I give up my life?’
It’s an absurd strategy, but that was the first thought that came to Zulu’s head.
side.
After one sharp squeak, Zulu stopped sucking on the pacifier.
When the thought that circulated everything stopped, Zulu’s true face was revealed for the first time.
‘Isn’t it truly amazing?’
Kali realized that what she had been fighting so far was only a human shell called Zulu.
The reality of Zulu, hidden in the never-ending flow of circulation, was the same nature as Kali, the god of death.
Middle Eastern language, shady and in some sense even mysterious, flowed out of Zulu’s mouth like the first line of a song.
“The greatest fear of man is not death.”
Kali understood the Zulu language as if it were her mother tongue, learned from birth.
“Is that so? Then what is your greatest fear?”
“Life with death on its back.”
Zulu equipped sergeant.
“Erga.”
A black bird was summoned and perched on Zulu’s shoulder.
The first Tier 10 monster she summoned when she was only three years old.
Kali made an expression of incomprehension at the appearance of the small and ungainly pet.
“Are you going to deal with me with just that?”
Zulu ignored it and continued.
“Human beings are truly strange beings, even though they know about death, they deny it. In fact, there is no death in their lives. It is a human being who knows he could die for some reason right now, but thinks it will never happen.”
“Are you trying to say otherwise?”
“Death is… … .”
Zulu looked at Erga’s wings flying above her head, then turned her head.
There was an indescribable dark aura in her eyes.
“It was always on my back.”
“gibberish.”
Carly took the posture to charge again with the skeleton at the forefront.
Then Erga blocked Zulu’s path and spread her wide beak to repeat Zulu’s words.
“Death was always on my back.”
Carly’s advance stopped.
It’s because Erga’s voice is perfectly identical to Zulu’s.
“This monster is the first creature I successfully summoned. Her name is Erga.”
“so? Are you saying you want to die together in the end?”
“Summoning magic is done through the omnipotence of the boss. There are three stages in a boss, which are the process of imprinting, empathizing, and disappearing.”
Zulu turned to herself and looked at Erga, who was puffing her beak, with cold eyes.
“Erga was the first creature to come to me. we were always together that’s the imprint We got to know each other well. that’s empathy And finally… … .”
When Zulu turned to Carly again, her face was no longer normal.
extreme loneliness.
There was nothing in her expression, like the scenery of some planet that had not been visited by a single being since her birth.
Carly realized the identity of the strange feeling she felt when she first revealed her true self.
There is no love.
She was a human made with a complete lack of affection.
“Can I tell you something fun?”
Tears of blood began to flow down Zulu’s drooping eyes.
“At the time, I was three years old. I don’t know exactly, but maybe that was it. And I… … .”
Erga’s black body began to crush with a crunching sound.
The black lump, like minced meat, writhed unpleasantly and began to unravel into a huge body like a scroll unwinding.
Key E E E E E E E!
As a grotesque scream shook Shion, the 10-meter-tall Shinigami revealed its identity.
The robe had an exceptionally long waist and had its head bowed.
The bony skeleton’s fingers hung down at the end of its long sleeves.
It was as if a hole had been pierced through the space by the lobe, whose light absorption rate was close to 100 percent.
Although a death mage called a tier 1 monster, Zulu had never encountered a lich in his life.
Thus, the lich is her incarnated self.
It was a reflection of her distorted desire for brutally killing the first life she met.
“Erga!”
Zulu’s face, clutching at his chest and weeping blood, seemed to represent the face of the lich hidden under his robes, his soul draining away.
oh oh oh oh oh!
Carly felt an unfamiliar feeling in Richie’s appearance.
A great fear that could only be encountered from her owner, Faiel.
Death is the end of life, but it is not the end of everything.
The true end lies beyond death. eternal solitude.
The loneliness emanating from the lich was making Kali tremble.
“Ergaaaaaaa!”
Zulu’s voice was vaguely distant and stimulating, as if coming from the underworld.
i killed
He brutally strangled the neck of the first friend he met because he thought that if he took his life, he would stay by his side forever.
‘I can’t do this.’
Carly wielded all four weapons at the same time, distorting her expression terribly.
‘No human being can overcome the fear of death.’
Death is the ruler of living things.
“Destroy!”
Kali’s sword cut through the lich’s robes, but it was hers that cut.
Nothing can be cut in the empty void.
oh oh oh oh!
Richie reached out his bony hands and covered Carly.

“This is pretty… … Interesting.”
The Nephilim Nameless, born between the Angel of Achievement and Garas, was muttering something outside the curtain of Stop that Armin had spread.
In Armin’s world, the realm of the speed of light that only he is supposed to have reached.
It was clearly a state beyond dozens of barriers even to an unknown born with an endless desire to achieve.
However, for him, who has far greater insight than humans, the barrier was only a matter of time after all.
“Ohh. aha. Right.”
Armin got goosebumps at the sight of him nodding his head from start to finish with his sword hanging down.
I didn’t take any action, but I was convinced every time I saw his eyes shining every moment.
growth? Awakening? Evolution?
It was clear that it was approaching, chewing and swallowing the land at a speed that is impossible to explain with any human concept.
‘damn! At this rate… … !’
Just when Armin was thinking about taking a gamble, a dark wind blew past the unknown.
visor!
Anonymous easily raised his sword to block Kuan’s attack and launched a counterattack.
Like a scholar engrossed in an old study getting wind, the face that pushed Kuan was extremely calm.
‘Damn it.’
Kuan was displeased with that expression.
In a situation where he risked his life and unfolded sword fighting, he had sleepy eyes.
Is the clash of swords just a childish play to the nameless?
‘Do you know how to laugh at swords?’
Kuan vibrated, drawing out external gravity in all directions.
The body vibrating left and right passed by the nameless at some point.
“Gagging!”
Dozens of scars were formed on Kuan’s body, and blood gushed out.
Rolling on the floor and centering himself, he glared at the nameless in disbelief.
“this… … It was too shallow.”
Moo-myung brushed off the blood on the blade and turned his head.
“Next time it will be a little deeper.”
Kuan’s teeth gnashed in Angdamun’s mouth.
The dozens of small wounds he received as a reward for not allowing a fatal blow rather hacked his pride in his swordsmanship.
As Kuan kicked off the ground and jumped out, Nameless came rushing in.
The two swordsmen, who had collided head-on, seemed to be competing for a moment, but in just a few seconds, wounds began to form on Kuan’s body again.
Siena, who had been watching the battle from behind the curtain of stop, hurriedly stood up.
“We have to get out!”
Kuan’s ability cannot subdue the nameless.
Even if the skill was taken away, it was the best decision to see the game in the early stages.
At that moment, Armin hugged Siena and pulled her down to the floor.
“brother?”
“… … .”
When Armin didn’t answer, Siena finally realized what he was thinking.
“brother! Let go of this!”
However, no matter how hard he tried, Armin would not let go of Siena.
Anonymous who has already conquered flicker magic will not miss all three of them here.
If Kuan somehow created an opportunity, it was best to run away with Siena.
“brother! brother!”
Siena shook her body more violently and tried to tear Armin away.
But at some point, it seemed to freeze and stopped moving, eyes wide open, looking straight ahead.
There was a smile on the lips of the nameless who had cut Kuan.
“Aha, this is delicious.”
Kuan stood with his back for a moment, then turned around with a bitter expression.
Finally, a fatal blow, Kuan’s side split open, and red blood gushed out like a fountain.
“ha.”
A groan of rage leaked from his mouth.
“I’m going to really go crazy.”

[500] Despair. despair (3)
Kuan tightened the muscles with the schema to stop the bleeding. And he calmly pointed his sword as if he had never done that.
“Oh, you have such a skill.”
An incontinent smile crept across the unknown’s lips.
The insight of penetrating and applying the human body schema just by looking at it remained in the realm of incomprehensibility from the human point of view.
“But I don’t need it.”
At the same time as Nameless Charged, 24 external gravitational forces erupted from Kuan’s body.
Each external gravitational force made Kuan’s body oscillate, repeating expansion and contraction like a ball connected to a rubber band.
It was an extremely bizarre movement, but to Mu-myeong, it was just a fixed path like a single road.
As if to prove that fact, Mu Myung put pressure on him by showing a superior movement than Kuan.
A trajectory that transcends all predictions and predictions that humans can make, and even the realm of imagination and delusion.
“Keugh!”
Another fatal blow landed Kuan on the floor with a distorted face.
After confirming that Moo-myeong pushed through the twin swords, he raised the sword, but was pushed to the wall by the force of the charge.
Kaka Kaka Cak!
The blade was firmly fixed while rubbing a short distance, and the gazes of the two swordsmen collided between the blades.
“Aha, now I understand.”
Now, obscurity’s attention was focused on Kuan, not swordsmanship.
It is understandable that Armin created a barrier with stop magic.
This is because the moment the barrier disappears, he casts flicker magic and is confident that he can kill two people in an instant.
However, I wondered why Kuan, who realized the difference in skill, gave up on his life and rushed into it.
In the end, the answer he gave was a very inefficient and unreasonable human mind.
“Am I dying to save them?”
Kuan made eye contact with Siena briefly.
It was a momentary sincerity that even the prosecutor’s superhuman nerves couldn’t suppress.
And Moo-myeong did not miss the woman’s face reflected in Kuan’s eyes.
According to memory, it is love.
Even calling him father is detestable, but the desire to reproduce the race is at the highest level among Garras’ animal nature.
‘No, if that’s the case, it doesn’t make much sense.’
Garas does whatever it takes to satisfy his desires, even transforming his body.
However, Kuan’s behavior tended to go against the basic nature of such animals.
“They intend to use you as bait to escape. Besides, she doesn’t love you. Rather, she wants to have a child with the man next to her. But why are you behaving like this?”
Although the desire for breeding has been converted into a desire for achievement, it is basically a being endowed with the genetic material of Galas.
If you saw and felt it with the eyes of an unknown person, it was an unquestionable fact.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa.”
Kuan drew in a deep breath.
Even if he didn’t bother to borrow Garas’ advice, he knew at least that Siena had a crush on Armin.
But why are you doing this?
If the only thing you get in return for saving Siena and Armin is death, what are you fighting for?
‘It would be nice, wizards.’
Wizards always make the best choices.
Therefore, Siena’s judgment with Armin should have been correct this time as well.
Just like the time when he talked about death without hesitation to himself who rushed to the restaurant as soon as he received an emergency payment.
I wanted to be by Siena’s side.
I wanted to stay as the only man, not as a prosecutor.
And at this moment, Kuan gave up all hope.
“What do I know, idiot.”
Kuan let out the breath he had been holding up until now and swung his sword.
Anonymous, who took a few steps back, frowned as if looking at an insignificant existence.
“You fool. To choose death without even knowing the justification for one’s own actions. Is it human?”
As I aimed my twin swords at the rushing Kuan and opened my eyes, I thought my nameless arms were released like smoke, and then a high-speed slash wrapped around the front.
Woo woo woo woo!
A speed that can be called a sword curtain.
Dozens of blades rushed into Kuan’s eyes as the air made a burning sound.
‘I found it, my grave.’
Even in the situation of absolute death approaching, Kuan strangely felt a surge in his heart.
The grave he chose was in Siena’s heart.
If he could die for her in front of Siena, that would be it.
‘I know. Not childish.’
Kuan’s body rapidly changed its trajectory and bypassed the sword screen.
‘Actually, I’m angry… … .’
I couldn’t stand it because I was jealous that Armin was hugging Siena, but I couldn’t even say a word.
Kuan whirled around Nameless even faster.
In response, the nameless sword bent like a snake and chased after him, leaving dozens of wounds on Kuan’s body.
Even if it wasn’t a fatal wound, it was a lethal amount of blood.
“Let go! Let go of this!”
Siena was calling out to Kuan, but the sound did not cross the barrier of time.
“Siena! calm down! It is not yet time!”
Armin’s heart was miserable as well.
There is a slight possibility of overcoming this difficulty if the flicker magic closes the gap and puts a stop to the nameless.
However, if Nameless avoided the magic in the same way, there was only a 100% chance that Siena would die.
“wait! Be patient a little longer!”
“Mr Kuan! Mr. Kuan!”
In the scenery where the world rotates at high speed, Kuan gazed at Siena’s face for a moment.
‘Yes, this is me.’
A clown who dances with swords in front of her, hoping that she will understand his feelings.
“Ku-k-k-k-k! Whoop whoop whoop!”
Kuan laughed with his lungs moving, but his distorted face looked like he was crying.
“Yes, I will give you the title of sword genius.”
Kuan, who had been avoiding repeatedly, finally infiltrated the inside of the sword screen.
“I am a black demon.”
Woo woo woo woo!
As external gravity stretched out in all directions, Kuan’s body spun like a top.
“huh?”
Since the two swordsmen were already performing movements beyond human imagination, those watching did not even detect a change.
However, Nameless, who deeply understands the true meaning of external gravity, felt a sense of dread for the first time during the battle.
‘What is this?’
Kuan’s movements were ambiguous.
If the trajectory so far has been a single road, it suddenly feels like it has split into two paths where you have to make a decision.
‘No, even if I do, it won’t change anything. Does not matter.’
If there are only two branches, you can subdue them all.
Moo-myeong, who passed by Kuan and cut three places in an instant, was shocked without a smile of repentance.
‘Did you get cut?’
The moment he turned his head with an expression of disbelief, the skin on his right shoulder cracked and blood splattered.
For the first time in my life, the wound I experienced was a terribly unpleasant and repulsive sensation.
However, his psychological state was so confused that he couldn’t even pay attention to the pain.
‘When the hell?’
It was a two way road.
No, it is stupid to deny the results that have already come out.
So what can you think of… … .
‘Another road I couldn’t see?’
Is it possible?
With that thought in mind, Kuan turned around with an evil face like a demon in the nameless eyes.
“Cheuk, it was shallow. But this time it will be a little deeper.”
Swords collided with each other again.
In a brief moment that seemed like one, dozens of joints crossed, and the flesh of the unknown left thigh fell off again.
invisible
Kuan’s sword was moving unexpectedly.
“That could happen… … !”
The anger when suppressed was as intense as the desire for great achievement.
As his pride was trampled on, the explosive emotions in Garras’ nature reached an all-time high.
“No, no!”
As dozens of external gravitational forces pulled the cotton together, his movement line began to bend like crazy.
Seeing the complicated trajectory as if a handful of yarn had been tangled up, Kuan muttered without blinking an eye.
“… … It’s annoying.”
visor!
The clashes of the swords reached dozens of times, but because they were so fast, they exploded into the world as a cacophony.
A line of blood was engraved on Kuan’s back as he staggered to a halt, and blood gushed out.
“ha! ha!”
A red line was drawn on the nape of the nameless neck, which stopped moving with a rapid breath, and the skin was cut.
“this… … !”
I missed Kuan’s sword again.
However, it turned the confidence of ignorance into doubt again.
There was no way that his own imagination, far above human insight, could not overwhelm Kuan.
“It’s strangely annoying… … .”
At some point, Kuan is muttering the same thing.
It felt like my head was open again, just like when I gained enlightenment at the cost of giving up my life and attacking Fengzhang.
“Aha, that’s right. I get it now.”
Kuan staggered back like a drunk.
In fact, his pupils, which had been immersed in deep thoughts and then escaped, were opened in a hazy way, as if he was half out of his mind.
“That was all it took.”
Perseok!
The sound of flesh and bone breaking at the same time was heard.
Even Siena, who was shouting Kuan’s name in succession, and Armin, who sensed an opportunity and decided to run away, went pale in their heads.
Moo-myeong made a dull sound and blinked at Kuan’s right arm, which had fallen to the floor.
It is cut exactly below the shoulder.
He cut off his own arm.
‘why?’
It may vaguely make sense, but the first thing that comes to mind is that this kind of behavior is never an achievement.
‘I limited myself to the possibility of development. Are you crazy?’
“Now, how about this?”
At the sound of Kuan’s voice, Mu Myung raised his head again.
The appearance of holding out a sword with the only remaining arm was clearly weaker than before, but the situation changed rapidly after a while.
Based on where Kuan was standing, I began to have the illusion that the landscape had tilted to one side, as if the ground had collapsed.
Asymmetric clown clown clown.
“you… … .”
For the first time, fear flashed in the unknown eyes.
It was an achievement towards death that only humans with biases can reach.
* * *
“why? Why?”
Flew hugged Crude before he fell and carefully laid him on the ground.
It was embarrassing to even say that the bones in his body were already broken and bent.
Crude’s hazy gaze could not settle down and wandered around the sky.
Piper’s frame prevented her from being crushed, but the pain would have been worse.
“Why did you come to see me? why? If you’re going to die like this, why did you come to me!”
Fleur shouted at the dying Crude.
Even though I knew it was a cruel act, I couldn’t bear the anger exploding in my heart.
“you… … I hate it so much… … .”
Crude said in a dying voice.
“I have no family.”
Flew’s face contorted into tears when he realized everything with a short word.
“At least there must be a reason to die… … .”
“stop! I don’t want to hear that! What are you saying to me! What should I do if I end up like this and say such things!”
Crude gave a faint smile.
Giving everything to the woman you loved.
After giving up even the most precious life, it will stay in her heart forever.
Perhaps that is the greatest revenge.
“Flu… … . love… … under… … .”
Crude’s tongue hardened and her eyes closed.
Fleur hugged the corpse of Crude, who dropped her head, with her trembling arms.
The more she tried to hold it in, the bigger the emotion, and eventually she couldn’t stand it and sobbed.
“AA AA AA!”
Hate it because you loved it, and hope that at least that hatred will be known, and eventually die.
It is the human mind without substance, and therefore without end.
The mind was sitting like a heavy rock on Flew’s chest, catching his breath.
