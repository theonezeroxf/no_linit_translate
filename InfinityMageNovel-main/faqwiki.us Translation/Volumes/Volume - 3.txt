[51] Strange Research Society (3)
“My major is computational physics.In terms of the size, speed, and shape of the space, it can never happen without the universe.The figures are too large to be implemented on the continent.”
“But how could I have such a dream?”Psychological regression is my memory, but I’ve never been to space.”
“Perhaps so, but even if you don’t go into space, memories can exist.And from here on out, it’s Nade’s major again.”
As soon as I heard Eruki’s words, I suddenly had an idea in my head.
“A portrait…”
Nade nodded.
“Yes. In the Spiritual Warfare Experiment, the condemned man was unconscious and aware of the situation in each country for a month.How is that possible?I wonder if he had heard the story because it was like a pigeon flying in the air.Of course, that’s possible, but I think it’s too human-centered.Eyes and ears are biological organs with accurate development systems.There can’t be such a thing in the soul.The soul must be a substance with unique characteristics.When it was electrically decomposed, it had a strange effect.combine with other information, or fly quickly beyond time and space.”
Eruki agreed with Nade.
“Electrons cannot observe and measure at the same time.It’s like you can’t check the position of the string when you bounce the guitar string.There is only a probability within the range of vibration.This is called quantization, and if the soul is ionized, it doesn’t matter if it’s the universe.It’s a world where the correlation between time and distance is broken.”
Shirone slowly remembered his head.Nothing has been solved yet, but when the logic and evidence were presented, the fear felt much lessened.
“Well, I think I got the hang of it now.Thank you very much.You’re like a member of the psychic science research team.
“Ha-ha! You shouldn’t be so surprised.Anyway, don’t worry too much.I’m not under a curse.I think it’s related to the Immortal Function, so let’s look into that in the future.”
Shirone nodded and made up his mind.
“All right! I’m going to join the Psychic Science Society.”
Nade had no reason to say no.Above all, when Shirone comes in, there are three members.It will be registered as an official research group, and subsidies that were cut off a year ago will also be provided.
“We are always welcome.Eruki, do you agree?”
“Well, for the vision of the Research Council, Shirone is certainly a good recruitment.But will the management accept it?There must be a lot of teachers who are against it because it’s so notorious.”
“Leave it to me.All I have to do is slip in the papers without the teachers knowing.Let’s go now!”
As Nade left the lab, as if he could not wait for a moment, Shirone laughed and followed Yiruki.Then, just before closing, I looked at the lab.It’s like a warehouse and dusty, but when I think of it as my own research group from now on, I felt the atmosphere.
“But I’ll have to clean it up.”
Shirone closed the door and put out the fire outside.There was no sign of silence in the dark room.The dust on the sofa was spinning quietly around where Shirone sat.
overflow (1)
The atmosphere in the teacher’s office was unusually busy.
Most of the teachers who finished the class waited for the next class while drinking tea or chatting, but now all the teachers were working together to classify the documents.
The task of classifying dozens of applications for membership one by one, writing them in the report, and handing them over to the department in charge took more work than expected.
Siena, who had just returned from her lesson, did not speak and headed for the pile of papers she had placed on a large desk.
“Oh, are they all applications?”There’s a lot of traffic this week.”
“Well, it’s the end of the semester, isn’t it?”It happens all the time at this time of year.”
When the semester ends and the vacation begins, students must submit their thesis on a free topic by the next semester.
However, since such performance evaluation can be replaced by a presentation of the research group, it has been a recent trend for students who do not have a research group to join the research group temporarily at the end of the semester.
Said Thaad, who was helping with the work.
“Children only have more tricks.It wasn’t like this before.The research group and the performance evaluation were enthusiastic.I think kids these days are too efficient.”
“Ha-ha! It’s different from before.The competition has become fiercer than it was 10 years ago, and children must be stressed out in their own way.The reason for holding a temporary research group is to buy time for personal study.”
“But aren’t you too obsessed with results?There’s also the romance of my school days.”
The teacher seemed to sympathize with Sadr’s words and just smiled bitterly.After taking the documents, he was handing them over to the department in charge when she found the documents that had fallen under her desk.
“There’s one missing here,”
“Oh, when did you come in?”You must have left it in class.”
“Hoo-hoo. You must have been in a hurry.”
Siena examined the papers to see which student had been clever.And when I checked his name, he looked suspicious and fixed his glasses.
“It says… Shirone, right?”
The teacher pecked out his face to confirm.
“I see, Aryan Shirone.I thought you weren’t interested in the research group.Well, the students are playing tricks on each other, so there’s nothing we can do about it.”
Sadr snatched the application form and frowned.
“I don’t think so,”This is a very famous research group, isn’t it?”
“Let me see it again.
Siena received an application form from Sad and looked at the research group Shirone joined.
Indeed, it was a famous place.
“Supernatural Psychological Science Research Society.”
It was a name like a bolt out of the blue.
I still have a headache when I think about how I fought with graduates from here every year since I was appointed as a teacher.
“Oh? Come to think of it…….’
Didn’t most of the troublemakers at the Psychological Research Society graduate the previous year?I remembered hearing at first glance that the subsidy was cut off due to a lack of membership.
said the teacher with a smile.
“And then I heard that Eruki also belonged to the research institute.I think we’re on the same wavelength.”
Sadr burst into a dejected laugh.
“I’ve heard that you did a great job on the targeting test.But you seem to be on good terms with each other.I don’t think you have the right personality.”
said Siena, with a keen look on her face.
“Yes. That’s why it’s a problem.”
If Eruki, who is as talented as Shirone, had enticed him, Shirone, who was stubborn, might have changed his mind.
But what do you mean, “Eruki?
I’m not the worst person in the school.Even if they were geniuses, Shirone and Eruki were in the opposite direction.
It could be helpful for each other’s development, but it could be a problem in which either side could be eaten up or co-destroyed by conflict.That would have been a great loss for the school.
“I’d rather do it,”At this point, let’s break off the vicious circle.”
Siena opened the file and looked at who the chairman of the Psychological Science Research Council was.
As expected, it was Nade.
Recently, a research group that includes two people who are said to be closest to Shirone.
At this point, I thought I understood why Shirone, who had been away from the research group so far, joined.
“Nade’s teacher is…….’
Siena looked for the teacher in charge, pointing out the names of the teachers.Then, as soon as he checked his name, he sighed and touched his forehead.
“Sigh, of all things…….’
* * *
A training center located outside the magic school.
Ethella was meditating with her cross-legged.
The Carris Monastery she attended was the best monastery in the kingdom, with more than 1,000 monk apprentices.Hundreds of children come in every year with their parents’ hands, but only a small percentage of them become monks in recognition of their talents.
Ethella was unique among such children.
She became the youngest bishop, leaving many high-ranking nobles and even royalty behind.
The position of bishop is not just a position where one can rise just because one is skilled.The reason why Ethella caught the eyes of her predecessors was that she discovered her nature as a compositional leader.
It will be the light and salt of the world.
With this mindset, Ethella, who vowed to live her whole life, turned a blind eye to wealth and fame and became a teacher at the Alpeas School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
“Thank you for letting me finish my education safely today.”’
Therefore, Ethella is different from other teachers.First of all, the origin itself was not a school or magic association, but a monastery.
If the wizard critically looks at the world, Monk does not analyze the world but wants to keep it in his mind.
Her infinite appreciation for nature, which allowed her to exist, and her sense of mission to share her heart with others were all that made up her.
Ethella slowly opened her eyes.Her eyes penetrating the air were young.
I could sense a woman approaching here through the Spirit Zone.I felt a woman approaching through the Spirit Zone.
It is difficult to determine the gender of an object with a general spirit zone.However, she was Jonah, the authority of Spirit Zone, and had a higher level of exploration ability than any other wizard.
If you liken an ordinary spirit zone to air, Jonner’s spirit zone is a liquid.As such, the density of the medium is high, so you can feel the synesthesia much clearer.
Ethella rose from her seat and waited for her guests.It was a long time before Siena opened the door and greeted him with a smile.
“Welcome,”Mr. Siena.”
Siena was not surprised that Ethella was waiting in advance.I knew how clear Jonah’s spirit zone was.
“You’re in training, aren’t you?”Do I disturb you?”
“No, I was about to finish.Come on in.”
“Well, I’ll excuse me.
It was rare for Siena to come to the training center.Ethella heated the tea, thinking it would take a long time to talk.
I laid a cushion, but sitting on the floor was unfamiliar to Siena.But she knelt politely and politely received the car that Ethella handed her.
While drinking her first cup, she had heard that it was polite of the congregation to refrain from conversation, so she did not say a word until she emptied her bitter tea.
Even though the sun was long because it was summer, the golden sunset was thick.Siena, who wanted to start the conversation before dark, emptied the teacup a little faster.
Ethella spoke thoughtfully first.
“It’s not a light thing to come all the way here.”
“Yes. I have something to discuss.”
“I see. What’s the matter?”
“You’re in charge of Nade, aren’t you?”
“Yes. He’s a bright and good student.”My grades are in the middle and upper ranks, but I have plenty of talent.It goes well with the children.”
“Do you know that the child is the chairman of the Psychic Science Research Society?”
“Of course. Did Nade do anything wrong?”
Siena raised her upper body as if she were determined.
“I’m going to dissolve the research group where the child is the chairman.I came because I thought it would be reasonable to ask the teacher in charge for understanding in advance.”
Ethella smiled softly and savored the tea.She, who had been lost in thought for a long time, spoke.
“If Mr. Siena means it, it must be for the students.But this time I’d like to know why.”
“Since ancient times, the Psychological Science Society has had many incidents.It was a notorious research group even before I took office.Of course, the school left it alone because of his achievements, but now the situation has changed.I looked through the papers and found that there was no official presentation for three years.I’ve done more than enough to be disciplined.”
“But isn’t it a thing of the past, as Siena said?”The students I’m working with are Nade, Eruki and Shirone.The key is what kind of activities those kids do, who are second only to the class four.”Can you keep an eye on me a little bit more?In addition, the Psychic Science Research Society is a fairly traditional research group at Alpeas School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.I understand that Mr. Gauld, the president of the Witchcraft Society, is also from there.”

[52] Overflow (2)
“It’s different from when Mr. Gauld was in school.It’s an era where students are absorbed in performance evaluation even if they cheat.In such a situation, talented children will be left behind if they pursue romance.”
“Hoo-hoo. That’s just like Mr. Siena.Well, the three of them are also promising prospects for the school.If those children fall behind, the school will suffer a lot of damage.”
Siena did not deny it.I want to make talented students bloom even more.That was the education center in Siena.
On the other hand, Ethella’s view of education was the opposite.You never favor or force someone to lead.I thought it was a way behind the competition.However, in terms of the results, the level of students she was in charge of was by no means inferior to those in Siena.
“Am I being selfish?”I don’t want to spoil the fun of my school days.But what will happen to the students’ future if it leads to a waste of talent?’
Siena sighed with difficulty.
“I don’t know.I’m not sure either.Why do talented children always try to get away with it?And why did Shirone join such a place?”
Ethella silently looked down at the teacup and was lost in thought.She was the only one who knew that Shirone had experienced nirvana.
It was Shirone’s, and it was Shirone’s land, so I didn’t want to tell her as much as possible, but it would not be the best thing to keep my mouth shut to Shirona, a dedicated teacher.
“Have you noticed anything strange about Shirone lately?”
“It’s Shirone, isn’t it? Well, it’s more than a coupleIt’s all because I’m hanging out with those kids.I guess Nade and Eruki were the reason for joining the research group.”
“Maybe there’s another reason.”
“What? What do you mean?”….”
“I’m sorry I haven’t told you so far.In fact, this happened during the speed gun test.”
Ethella told the story of Shirone entering Nirvana while targeting.Then Siena turned pale. She turned pale.
“Really? That’s an Immortal Function.”
Immotal function is the best, but it does not mean the best level.In some cases, street beggars are more aware of the depth than magicians.It was too dangerous a concept to be controlled by Shirone, who is still only a student.
“Why didn’t you tell me in advance?”This is a really big problem.”
Ethella thought there were no major and minor problems in the world.Everything was up to him, and Shirone wanted to make his own decision.
“Shirone’s already known.In fact, it’s strange not to know.Nirvana is the ultimate enlightenment that even I have never experienced.I thought there was no room for me to intervene.
“I understand how Mr. Ethella feels.You can’t force others to do what you don’t know.But what if an overflow occurs?It may be irrevocable then.”
Overflow is a common phenomenon found in children who awaken their genius at a mentally immature age.
The whole mind refers to a state of silence like water in a bowl.However, when it overflows, it becomes crazy because it can’t control itself.This is why there are many wild or eccentric personalities among geniuses.
The earlier you experience overflow, the more talented you are, but for Siena, it was an irresponsible remark from the public who liked to follow geniuses.
Siena also experienced overflow at the young age of nine.The world was not a rainbow of curiosity in her eyes.It was just a gray space dotted with mechanical rules.
I was overwhelmed with fear.So he locked the door and buried it in the dark.Despite the continued interest of the Olifer school, Siena’s condition showed no signs of improvement.
She remembers the dark world she stayed in for a year.and a ray of light that miraculously cut through the darkness.
The blond boy opened the door wide and held out his hand.If he hadn’t handed over his light, Siena would never have reached this position.
– Siena. Let’s get out of here.
Siena smiled bitterly as she recalled those days.Memories speak.that he should not let Shirone walk on the same path as he did.
Shirone achieved rapid growth in a short period of time.He was stimulated by interacting with numerous talented people, and broke the limit in a row through fierce competition.If it was an Immortal Function, nothing else, the possibility of overflow was quite high.
“Mr. Ethella,”When I was a child, I suffered from overflow.I’m sure Mr. Ethella does, too, right?
“Yes, of course,”
Siena realized that she was a Umun.The average age of wizards is 28 years old.However, the two were not only 26 years old, but had already stayed in this class for six years.
Considering that the average time to be promoted from level 6 to level 5 is 10 years, he was already a wizard in the top ranks even in level 6.
With this level of genius, it was rather strange that there was no overflow.
“I first experienced it when I was seven.That’s why I entered the Carris Monastery.But I was able to escape safely because I met good people.”
She was slightly moved by the fact that her experience was two years ahead of her, but soon shook her head.
The younger you are, the more likely you are to collapse due to overflow.Even before they knew the world, the terrifying fear they faced would not have been enough for a child to handle.
“You must have had a hard time.”
“I was really afraid.If I hadn’t entered the monastery, I probably wouldn’t have lived normally.”
In other words, a seven-year-old would have awakened as soon as he knew the world.The Ethella could have caught on because it had become a Carris monastery, where the nation’s top leaders were gathered.
“But why did you leave Shirone unattended?”You know the fear of overflow better than anyone else.”
“Shirone and I are different.I’m 18 years old, not seven or eight.Overflow is dangerous because the container to hold the mind is not solid.But I think Shirone has the capacity to overcome it.Overflow, on the one hand, is the process of accepting genius.If we overcome this crisis, Shirone will grow further.”
What Ethella said made sense.In fact, it was after the overflow of Siena’s magical talent.
However, it was possible because of the miraculous help.And those who were precious in return lost their light.
“It’s not that I don’t know what Siena is worried about.However, just because you are caught in an overflow doesn’t mean you’re all going to collapse.And so did I.”
Ethella is just a unique case.Overflow may not have been such a big threat to her, who is carrying out with all her heart.said Siena with such a heart.
“I know Shirone’s bowl is not small.However, I have awakened my mental function.I mean, the worst could happen.If that happens, will Mr. Ethella be responsible?”
“We don’t teach students to take responsibility.I’m sure Shirone will get through it.”
“But…!”
“But,”
said Ethella firmly, putting down the teacup.
“If the worst happens, I’m ready to make amends for the child for life.”
Siena shut her mouth.Ethella’s determination went beyond the teacher to the monk’s spirit of sacrifice.
If she had not sincerely cared for the students, the free education policy would also have been nothing more than neglect.Perhaps it wasn’t himself who lacked determination?
Siena, who had put her hands together, bowed her head and said good-bye.
* * *
The Iron Gate of the Psychological Science Research Society has opened.In the dust rising from the floor, Shirone gasped and floundered his arms.Leaving Shirone behind, Nade came in with a tired look.Then he left his bag behind and jumped into the sofa.
Eruki was playing chess.I was alternately holding black and white, but my hands moved without even thinking.When the first round was over in an instant, he rearranged his words and started the next round.
“Are you here? How was your day?”
said Nade, with his feet on the back of the sofa, in a sleepy voice.
“Well, nothing particularly interesting happened.”
Shirone sighed at the sight of his friends.Eruki skipped classes and played chess every day, and Nade’s only thing he could do was sleep.
“Irookie, you missed the afternoon session again, didn’t you?”What are you going to do if you get paid?”
“It’s all right. You can improve your grades as much as you miss your attendance.”
It’s a hateful answer, but I can’t refute it because what Eruki says is true.Currently, Eruki is holding out in the class five with only science and engineering scores.On the contrary, it meant that the humanities score was zero.There was room for an average of 20 points in the overall performance, so it was okay to relax.
“But isn’t that too much?”I’ve never seen anyone who doesn’t study this hard on Class Five.’
Eruki, who skipped classes every day, was avoiding failure only with science and engineering scores, and even Nade was lazy but did not miss the middle and high grades.Looking at this, I felt like a fool to study with all my might.
“I think I shouldn’t have joined the research group.”
“What’s wrong with this?”You know there’s no softening, right?
“No, I mean it.If I stay here, I’ll get weird first.”
“What are you talking about?”What did we do?
“You say it’s a research group, but you don’t do any activities and just play.On the other hand, the results are better than mine.I think I’m getting more anxious because I’m with great kids like you.”
“Do you think that joke is funny?”You gave me a bowl of rice in the test. What should I do?”
“I know. He’s so humble that he sounds so arrogant.”
Nade joined in.It made no sense to compare Shirone’s grades, which were less than a year old, with those who had been educated since childhood.
“No, I mean it.From now on, I’m going to cut back on my research group activities.You don’t want to do a performance test anyway, right?I’d rather study at that time.”
Only then did Eruki and Nade realize that they meant it.It seemed that I couldn’t stand being anxious if I didn’t study for fear that someone was not a model student.
“Why don’t you study here?”
“Huh? Here?”
“Well, we’re a little sorry for you, too.I’d like to hang out with you, but I’m afraid it’s disturbing you.It’s not bad to do it here, is it?Maybe we’ll be stimulated, too.”
“Well,”
Shirone, lost in thought, nodded.I didn’t think that I would study well in such a bizarre research group, but it was worth trying if it stimulated my friends.Sweeping the garbage on the table to the floor, he put his bag on it and said,
“All right, then I’ll study here.Instead, don’t interrupt.”
“Hehe. Don’t worry.We’re busy in our own way.”
As soon as Nade finished speaking, he lay down on the sofa.
“What shall we do now?”It’s very boring.”
Shirone’s veins stood out in his temples.However, he suppressed his anger and began to study because this level would be nothing compared to the challenges ahead.Eruki, who has already played chess for 34 games, busily moved his phone and bishop and said to Nade,
“If you have nothing to do, read a picture book.I brought this month’s.”
“Oh, really?”
Nade, standing up like a bounce, crawled into a pile of garbage under the table.
“Picture book? Is it a collection of famous paintings?”
Nade, who was moving under his feet, was cumbersome, but Shirone was also interested in art, so he let it go for now.Nade, escaping from the garbage, crawled under the table and shook a book in the air.

“Hahaha! Latest issue of picture book!”How long have I been waiting for today?”
Shirone’s face flamed up as he glanced back at the picture book.From the cover, it was far from a masterpiece.The female’s nudity was drawn from neck to thigh, and the phrase “Women’s Human Body Research Society” was written along the sewing line.
“What is that strange book?”
“Aha. You don’t know.This is what picture books are called.It’s a privilege that only a few people can enjoy in a magic school.”
added Eruki.
“In a word, it’s an unproductive game for people who have nothing to do.(Laughs)
A picture book is a slang word used among students and is a book that combines a semi-nude drawing of a woman’s body.
Naturally, it was not an official publication, but an obscene book published by children majoring in painting in teams.
It was published in a place called the Women’s Human Body Research Society, which was an informal research group.Nevertheless, it was very popular among students I knew.This was because it was not just a seminar, but it was drawn for the characters of the magic school.
Girls, female teachers, sometimes male or male teachers, anyone who belonged to the school could be their model, so the school was also troubled.
The school periodically confiscates publications, but the key figures are still unknown because they are dot organizations and appearances are emerging.According to one theory, there is a rumor that the head of the Women’s Human Body Research Association is in the graduation class, but it was not confirmed.
Shirone looked blank when he heard the explanation.In a sense, it was a research group that did so much that it was incomparable to Eruki and Nade.
“Then does he read such a book?”I didn’t expect that.”
Eruki kept his eyes on chess and waved his finger.
“It’s just collecting information.The Women’s Human Body Research Society is very clever and collects all sorts of rumors.”
Nade showed me the back of the picture book.As Eruki said, a detailed explanation was attached.
The ingredients of female students’ origins and personal affairs were recorded in detail, but it was too much labor to be called a hobby.
The reason for insisting on the seminar was also a clever attempt to evade the civil law of the city of Creas.Nevertheless, his position was obscene, so even for laymen, he was far from art.
Nade, who turned the picture book over, exclaimed.
“Wow! This month is the best!”ROOKIE, can I open page 7 here?
“Whatever. I’ve got all the information in my head.”
Shirone stared blankly at Nade.Why is he trying to use it while opening it?
“I don’t study to do it…….”
Nade burst into laughter.I think it’s the first time.When a model student like Shirone enters the Supernatural Psychological Science Research Institute, which used to be a gathering place for losers.
“Shirone, get used to it quickly, too.”If you stay here, you’ll find that there are more interesting things to do than to teach.I’ll realize it’s definitely not a loss after a little while.”
Nade’s face, which was turning the next page of “Hee Hee Nak Rak,” suddenly.and, looking at Shirone’s eyes, he said,
“Well, Shirone,”Don’t be shocked.”
“What is it this time?”Is there anything else to be shocked about?”
“Well, here in the picture book……Amy senior has appeared.”
“What? Give it to me!”
Shirone snatched away the picture book in a hurry.An embarrassing picture was decorating the entire page.It was a realistic picture that could be believed to be real.
“Shirone, don’t get me wrong.Hey, how similar is that to a painting?I’ve always been curious.”
“What do you mean similar?And how do I know that?”
Eruki shook his shoulders and giggled.
“You don’t know Shirone’s personality?”I don’t think they’re really dating.Honestly, you haven’t even held hands yet, have you?”
“Well, you’re all right.You don’t care about other people’s love affairs.”
Shirone turned to the picture book again.Regardless of other thoughts, it was a great skill.Should I say that it feels like a person is alive on paper?
“I don’t know, but I think it’s a great talent.But why do you do this?’
Shirone tore the page open.It was really unpleasant for Amy to decorate the page in such a book.
“Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh…”
Nade burst into laughter as he tore the page with his head turned away, unable to look.
“Hahaha! What are you doing?”Don’t be too sensitive.It’s a product of imagination, except for the face.You haven’t even seen it in person.”
Shirone glanced at him.Whether it was imagination or reality, Amy was a friend who fought with Black Magischer.If I could, I would like to find a women’s human body research group and dismantle it.
“Anyway, let’s stop reading books like this and do something productive unless you’re going to study.It’s a research group. Are you going to be doing this all day?”
Realizing that studying here was originally easy, Shirone decided to find something he could do with his friends.
“Well, why don’t you take a look at Nade’s invention?”the patent list of Dr. Nade, the Doctor of All Things.”
“Oh, yes! I haven’t shown Shirone yet.”
Nade crawled under the table again.Curious about what was in the dump, Shirone leaned over and looked inside.To my surprise, the safe was concealed.
“Ta-da! What do you think, Shirone?”Can you see this?
Shirone blinked blankly.There was nothing in Nade’s hand.However, when I looked closely, I felt that the scenery was arong based on a certain boundary.
“No way”.
“Haha! This is the cloak of transparency!”
A transparent cloak is an object that uses electrical force to refract light and creates an illusion of light transmission, but it was the first time I had seen it in real life.
“Did you really make it?”This one?
Shirone could not believe it.There is no great knowledge of magic engineering, but I fully knew how valuable the cloak was.
Electrical magic is also strong in the field of battle, but it has infinite industrial value.
In fact, the magic mainly used by electric wizards was not a surprise magic, but an illusion-based magic.
If it is the best magic of the illusion family, you can cite invisibility, which is a transparent magic, and it was transparent magic that could produce the same effect.
Although it is not Nade’s original invention, being able to produce by imitating a transparent cloak required professional-level engineering.
“My dream is to be a magic engineer.Of course, compared to the expensive transparent cloak on the market, it’s very poor.First of all, the material is inferior, and the charging technology is low, so it only works for an hour after injecting electricity.But isn’t this good enough?”
Nade’s figure disappeared as he put on his cloak.The quality of the transparent cloak depends on the refractive index of light.If the refractive index falls below 95%, it cannot be called transparent, so a 1% difference becomes the criterion for determining technology.Currently, Nade’s ability cannot produce a 100% refractive index, but the transparency effect was a definite degree of completion.
As Nade moved on, a blurred boundary was detected.However, when it stopped, it was impossible to know that there was someone without observing them carefully.
Shirone was a series of admiration.It was only possible to independently create magic weapons sold on the market with alchemy knowledge as well as magical knowledge.
“That’s great. Wouldn’t it have been much better if you put that effort into your studies?”
“Hahaha! That’s possible.But I’m happiest when I make things rather than magic.There are many other things besides this.Let me see.”
Nade took some things out of the safe again.Miniatures of electric-powered wagons.Hologram vision, which is welcomed when a picture is placed on the revised edition, was also quite complete.
Some of them were flash bombs and smoke bombs incorporating Eruki’s ideas, but they fell short of Nade’s patent list.
Shirone realized from Nade’s enthusiastic introduction.It’s not a waste of talent.Rather, they were ahead of students of the same age in their field.
“This wagon’s power plant rotates at a tremendous speed per second…… Huh?”
Nade, who had been busy talking, looked up at the ceiling as the room shook suddenly.The vibration got worse, and the chessboard shook and the horses fell from side to side.
Eruki immediately ran out, checked the corridor, and came back.There was a sense of urgency on his face as if he had realized something.
“Oh, my God! The teacher is here!”Get rid of the things!”
“What? What’s the matter?”
There was no time to explain.Nade hid the picture book with skillful movements and put it in a safe with smoke bombs, the unofficial operating funds of the research group.When the articles against the school regulations were dealt with, Shirone, who was confused, took him to the sofa and shouted,
“Shirone! Sit here!”It’s an unexpected check!”
Eastarth’s trachea has begun to work.A red warning light flashing in the hallway soon announced that the warehouse where the research group is located will be summoned to the first floor.
“The teacher is coming?”But what if he’s sitting down?Let’s say hello.”
Nade sat down on the sofa, trying to get up.
“Never mind! Act as if nothing had happened.”If you get a picture book or a smoke bomb, you won’t end up keeping a low profile.”
“Oh? Oh, I see.”
Shirone recovered his mind with his unique mind.His friends shook their tongues even in the midst of urgency at the level of mind control that even made their faces feel cold.Having prepared themselves for a war, they waited for Eastas to reach the ground.
* * *
“Oh, that’s annoying.”
She rubbed her headache in her hair.It takes at least three minutes to pull the warehouse down to the ground floor from Eastas.It was enough time to cover up the scene as well as run away.
In the past, several teachers raided the Psychological Science Research Society without operating Eastas.However, he wandered around the building for more than an hour and eventually failed to find a laboratory.
On the other hand, the members freely went in and out of the laboratory.I had a rough idea of how it would be done.It analyzes the movement pattern of the cube around the laboratory to infer the movement line.
Eastas has been commercialized as a magic warehouse, but the manufacturer has still not released the design drawings.It was absurd for teachers to use it as a cover-up technique for the research group, as it was not enough for any student 20 years ago to solve such problems.m.
Siena folded her arms and clapped her legs until Eastas’ form was complete.Three minutes felt too long.
“The more I think about it, the more I get angry.How did you find a pattern that even the teacher couldn’t find?No, if you found it, you should use it for constructive work.What on earth should we do with these research groups?’
This is why the Society for the Study of the Darkness is a problem.If you simply do something bad, the school should control you.However, most of their intellectual abilities were already out of control of the school.
The Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society was composed of children with extraordinary minds enough to play with bad clubs such as Black Magisher if they wanted to.
“What was Shirone’s intention in joining the club?”Even if it’s an Immortal Function, what’s the use of these kids?Furthermore, if you join this team, your performance evaluation will be ruined.’
Nade, who is ordinary at school but is as alert as other underground children at the research group.Eruki, a troublemaker of Class Five who is born with the power of servant syndrome but takes classes whenever he is bored.Shirone, now the best model student in the school, intervened.How can three people, who don’t fit in no matter how much they think about it, get together and walk around?
“Do you mean talent attracts talent?”Well, Nade and Eruki can interact on an equal footing, but…….’

[54] Overflow (4)
Siena was determined to be weak.Shirone, who awakens the Immortal Function, may fall into overflow.Ethella said she could overcome it on her own, but if what she feared became a reality, Shirone’s life would be miserable.
While I was lost in thought, Eastas stopped.She went in without delay.Walking along the corridor, I opened the iron door with the sign of the Psychic Research Society of Supernatural and Psychological Sciences.
The children sat among the white smoke.Sure enough, when she saw her relaxed smile without a sign of surprise, she burst into anger again.
It was a familiar scene for her.The difference was that all the people who had clashed enough were now graduated, and that Shirone was newly added to the place where they were.
“Why do students change whenever they join this research group?”and no one else, but Shirone.”
He usually smiled brightly and greeted me, but now he had a perfect poker face.I expected it, but I couldn’t help feeling a little disappointed.Next to Nade, who was proudly crossing his legs, was Eruki, who leaned back against the chair and raised his head to the ceiling.She laughed and entered the atmosphere of pushing the teachers away just with her attitude.
“You don’t even say hello to the teacher?”These things…”
“I was so absorbed in the discussion that I was distracted.Welcome.”
said Nade, with a cold look.The research group, a self-organizing organization of students, was able to grow to one of the pillars of the magic school community by adhering to a method of thoroughly wary of interference from teachers.It couldn’t have been good to ignore such traditions and question them.
“Hmph. School is a school and research group is a research group, right?’
But today was the last time I was full of energy.The teacher’s meeting had already failed to approve the dissolution of the research group, and the teacher in charge, Ethella, had reached a convincing agreement.
“What’s the matter, sir?”These days, I’ve been quiet without any accidents.”
“I got an official letter about the research group.I’ve come to tell you in person.”
“Well, come on in.though shabby.”
Nade shook a seat off the sofa with his hand.It was as if nothing had been stabbed.
“Thank you. Why don’t you give me a cup of tea?”
“Can you trust me to drink my tea?”You know, if Eastas moves, no one will be able to find it.”
Siena laughed at me with one eyebrow raised.I already knew that there was no cold water in such a shabby warehouse, let alone a cup of cold water.Even though I didn’t like what they did, I didn’t hate them because they showed such wit.
“Yes, sir, you’re a little anxious, too,”Then I’ll just get to the point quickly.I want you to return the lab within a month.”
Nade’s eyes widened.He immediately returned to his student status with the same sound as a bolt from the blue, and asked.
“What? Return?Why all of a sudden?”
“After reviewing the papers, they didn’t meet the required number of members this semester.The school has already cut off the subsidy.So I’d appreciate it if you could arrange it within a month.”
“Wait a minute! Shirone has come in now!”From three people, it can be recognized as an official research group.”
“But isn’t there no activity?”If you want to save the research group, you have no choice but to produce research results within a month of maturity.Of course, I don’t know what kind of research I can do in the field of supernatural things.”
“That’s far-fetched!”Just because it’s a research group doesn’t mean you have to hold a presentation!”
“It’s a special situation.The lab is in Eastas, and it’s infamous.Few research groups are as inactive as you are.The reason why I gave you a month was because Mr. Ethella asked me to.I’m very grateful.”
Shirone was stunned.Now that I’m starting to love the research group little by little, I can’t believe it’s suddenly dismantled.
“But there is one way to save the research group.”
Nade pressed his face in a hurry.
“What’s that? What should I do?”
“Let’s get Shirogane out of this research group.Then I’ll close my eyes at least until the next semester.”
“What?”
Nade rose, as expected of Siena.
“No way!I didn’t force Shirone to come, and the three of us are friends who always hang out at school.”Why do you keep trying to tear it apart?”
said Eruki.
“Don’t worry, if I missed the lesson.When it comes to studying, we stick to our own ways.”
Shirone could not sit still and listen.
“I feel the same way.I know that the research group is notorious, and I know that Yuruki and Nade are not faithful to their lessons.However, they are also doing their best in their field.I’m not wasting my time.So please be kind to me.”
Knowing that Siena cared for Shirone very much, Nade looked forward to it, just in case.But she stuck to her principles and said straightforwardly:
“It’s no use saying that.More than anything, Shirone, it’s a decision I made for you.”
“What do you mean a decision for me?”I think I’m doing my best”.
“What has been going on with you lately, Shirone?”
Shirone’s heart sank.Nade and Eruki also avoided looking at Siena.
Siena saw their reaction and knew it.As expected, he told his friends everything.
“You’re so mean, aren’t you?In particular, Eruki, you would have known that Shirone might have fallen into an overflow, but why didn’t you tell the teacher?”
Shirone looked back at Eruki.
“Irookie. What’s overflow?”
“It’s just… It’s nothing.Should I say that it happens when you wake up higher than the current level?I did it when I was eight.”
Siena was not satisfied with Eruki’s explanation.
“If you fall into an overflow, your mind may collapse.I heard a story from Mr. Ethella about the facial function.If you miss the timing, you may not be able to recover.”
Shirone bit his lips and thought.Even now, she has nightmares every night and suffers from a sense of portrait.Sometimes I was worried that I might go crazy.If this situation persists, there was no guarantee that it would not.
Shirone asked Eruki again.
“Well, how was it?”In your case?”
“Well, I really didn’t have much.It was a little scary.I told my father that you were always like that, and that’s how you should live your whole life.”
Siena looked puzzled.I can’t believe that’s what my little son says when he cries.However, considering who Eruki’s father was, it was understandable.In any case, it was undeniable that his father’s neglect played a part until Yi Eruki’s eccentric personality was formed.
She asked Nade, feeling as if she were grasping at straws.
“Nade, what do you think of yourself as a friend?”
“Hahaha. I don’t know.I don’t know what overflow feels like.”
When she heard her friends’ experiences, she sighed, expecting Shirone to change her mind.Still, Shirone will follow his own will, for he has imprinted the danger.
“Anyway, for that reason, Shirone will withdraw from the research group.If you have a heart for your friends, admit it.The most important thing now is the state of Shirone’s mind.”
said Nade, with a reluctant look.
“Isn’t that the teacher’s judgment?”I don’t think so.
Siena sighed frigidly.Being stubborn even though you knew your friend’s condition was far from friendship.
“You don’t understand the fear of overflow.I’m sure Eruki will allow it.”
“No, I’m a little strange, aren’told you.Either way, Shirone’s own business, right?I don’t know why you care so much.”
It was a cold word to be said among friends.But this was the reason why they were friends.The fact that Shirone, the party involved, was not disappointed was proof that their way of thinking was based on the same rationality.
“Then you mean you don’t mind if Shirone goes crazy?”
“There’s no reason to be bad.But rather than that, I think Shirone can overcome it.It’s a lot to bear since I’ve decided to be the best on this floor anyway.”
Nade answered.
“I feel the same way.Come to think of it, aren’t you favoring Shirone too much?It doesn’t matter to us, but it can be quite burdensome for us.”
Nade thought for a moment, then added, his eyes shining.
“There is even a rumor among the students that the teacher sees Shirone as a man.”
Of course, such rumors have never spread.However, this method was the best way for teachers to take medicine.Siena was not easy either.She had clashed with the Dark Research Society for many years and had not nodded despite more severe rumors.
“Let’s say so.Then I can take on the role of Shirone now, right?”
Even teachers cannot arbitrarily withdraw students from the research group unless they violate the school rules.In this case, Nade’s consent was urgently needed as the research chairman’s decision was more important than the steering committee.
“Don’t force yourself.Does that mean the rumor that the teacher sees the student as a man is true?”
“If you think so, feel free to think so.I won’t give in.”
“Really? Then you can go out with me, too?”
Siena shook her head as if she didn’t even want to imagine it.
“No, that would never happen,”
“Look, sir, what you say is contradictory.After all, you have a partiality for Shirone.”
“I mean, Shirone’s good and honest, and he’s very popular, so that kind of rumor could spread.But you’re not, are you?”
“Can I be hurt now, sir?”
“No, I can’t.Listen. It’s useless to trap me like this.Even if I’m in my senior year, I never see my student as a man.But if I were to take Shirone, I wouldn’t mind hearing such a misunderstanding.Shirone needs constant attention.You’re the ones who’re pushing it.”
Instead of Nade, who was speechless, Eruki stepped up.
“I know you’re worried, but if you can’t get over the overflow anyway, that’s the limit.You’re not going to die.Isn’t it reasonable to believe in Shirone?”
“You’re not going to die?I wouldn’t do this if it were another matter.But it’s a mental function.There is no guarantee that the worst will not happen.”
“I suppose so, but it hasn’t happened yet.I feel that Ms. Siena is too worried about an uncertain problem.This is not an interest, but an obsession.”
“Obsession?”
Siena swallowed her saliva.I felt as if I had been exposed to the pain inside me.Perhaps Eruki’s words are not wrong.The darkness that came suddenly in her childhood had a bigger wound in her heart than the overflow.
“Now that you mention it, I think it’s my problem.”
Shirone took advantage of the silence to speak.
“I’m all right.To be honest, I’m scared, but I want to watch it more than that.I don’t know what will happen to me.And I don’t know if I can get over it.Even if you fall into an overflow, you will never resent your teacher.”
Shirone’s words reminded Siena of a dim memory.The man who saved himself from hell said the same thing.
– Siena. Look straight at what’s coming to you.No matter how scared you are, don’t turn away.Just because you close your eyes doesn’t mean it’s gone.
Go away! You don’t know anything!
“If I had the courage to do so…”….’

A terrible accident may not have occurred.He was as honest and pure as Shirone.
Then he lost his light.The genius whom God especially cared for lost his light because of himself, who was a coward.
“Yes, I understand your thoughts.”
Siena escaped from her recollection.
“I won’t respect Shirone’s idea and urge him to leave.”
“Well, when will you respect the chairman’s opinion before that?”
“Hoo-hoo. Can I afford to play with words?”It’s a month away.If the school fails to produce convincing results, the Psychological Science Research Society will be disbanded.The research group, which has produced many graduates, will end in your generation.”
Nade’s heart thumped down.Come to think of it, it didn’t just end up on the street.
The seniors of the Supernatural Psychological Science Research Association are in key positions in the magical society, breaking the school’s evaluation of being a jerk.In particular, Mykea Gauld, the current president of the Magic Association, has been a source of pride for generations.If the research group is cut off in their generation, they will have no face to go out to society and see them.
“Oh, I’m going crazy.What should I do?
It is said to give a month’s time, but it was only a political investigation to dismantle the research group.Above all, there has never been an official presentation at the Psychic Research Society.How can we logically identify the existence of ghosts or gods who may or may not exist?Nade, driven to a dead end, threw away all his face and clung to Siena.
“Teacher! Please give me a chance!”Is there any other way than a presentation?You know the truth, don’tOur research group is meaningful in itself!It’s the only research group that can criticize a magical society that only believes in logic!”
She didn’t even snort.
“So I’m just saying, please try to attack me.I can’t give in this time.It’s impossible to withdraw the agenda as it’s already on the teachers’ meeting.I want you to make the right decision.”
When Siena left the research group, the children sat down on the sofa with the sound of the iron door closing.My mind went blank as if I had just woken up from a dream.With a clang, Eastas’s tracheal device began to bring the lab back to its original location.
Gauge symmetry (1)
a leisurely holiday
On his usual day off, Shirone would be stuck in the library, but now he was sitting absent-mindedly in the central park.Eruki and Nade sat side by side beside him, and drank juice without hesitation.
“What time is it now?”
“I don’t know. It’s not night anyway.”
“You’re a genius,”
There was a cold silence.As Shirone sighed, two more sighs followed in a row.At last, unable to put up with it, Shirone jumped up and looked back at them and shouted,
“What are you going to do, Research Society?”Don’t you need to think about a topic to present when you’re like this?
“Well, let’s think about it.What are some research projects that we can get approved by the school?”
Nade shook his head.
“As far as I know, I’ve never given a presentation before.Of course, I’ve done a lot of interesting things, but the school won’t approve them as official research anyway.”
There is no way to raise the subject of supernatural psychological science to the professional realm.If such a method had existed, it would have already spread to the world in the name of science.
Shirone, who sat on the bench again, emptied his mind.I glanced at the legs of the passing girls and turned my head when I saw a woman who was sometimes developing, but my mind was blank.
“Oh? Look over there, boys.”
Nade pointed somewhere with a casual chin.A beautiful woman I had never seen at school was heading to the front door.I wore an ivory trench cord and heels, and the purple hair that I had permed came down to my waist and fluttered.
“Biologically, the design is good.”Who is it?”
“Is he a senior in the graduation club?”Usually, kids around my age don’t wear such mature clothes, right?”
While his friends were criticizing him, Shirone looked at him with his eyes wide open.Somehow the atmosphere was familiar.
“Are you, Siena?”
“Siena?”
Nade leaned out his upper body and examined it closely.It was certainly so. She did not wear glasses and untied his trademark neatly raised hair, but Siena was clear.
“Wow. That’s awesome.Does a person change like that?”
“I know. You’re a completely different person with your makeup on.By the way, Shirone, how did you know?Now that I see it, you have a good eye for women.”
“Huh? No. It just looks like it.”
The reason why Shirone saw through it at a glance was that he saw Siena’s head through the grass.But I couldn’t bring myself to say that the teacher had come at night, so I made up my mind.
“But where are we going?”I’ll put on makeup on you.”
“You’re off duty today, aren’t you?”It’s also a holiday.Maybe you have a date.”
“Isn’t Ms. Siena far from a man?”
“But I’m sure there’s at least one person I’If you’re 26 years old, you’re full of marriage.You should get married, too, don’t you?”
“Well, I mean……”
Nade’s thought-provoking eyes glistened in his head as he stroked his chin.
“Shall we follow her?”I’m curious.
“What are you going to do with me?”It’s your private life, isn’t it?”
“There’s nothing to do anyway.I don’t think I’m going to get the answer, and my head is going to explode.It’s a holiday anyway, so I’ll just have to come on.
Eruki was skeptical.
“Can you chase him without being seen?”He’s a certified sixth-degree wizard.Even if it wasn’t for the Spirit Zone, you’d have different eyes to look around.You’ll get caught soon, won’t you?”
“Well, here’s the deal.Eruki, you track down the teacher, and Shirone takes the interim contact.I’ll drop by the lab.”
Shirone saw through Nade’s thoughts.
“A transparent cape?”
“That’s it,”If you follow him in a cloak of transparency, even the teacher won’t notice.There’s no reason to open the Spirit Zone on a date.What do you think?”
“That’s a good idea, isn’t it?All right, then I’ll follow you from now on.Shirone, you bring Nade from the middle.”
Shirone sighed as Eruki rose from the bench and chased Siena.Indeed, they were very effective children in this way.
“Then I’ll bring a cloak of invisibility.Shirone, don’t ever miss Eruki.You can move while checking the points, right?
Since the direction of the city is limited by an artificial structure called length, the approximate movement path can be determined by checking the point.It was important to judge the timing of the return at the midpoint as it should not be too far from Nade.
Shirone nodded helplessly.Even in this situation, I hated myself who had already finished calculating in my head.
“All right, but come quickly.I’m not confident for more than ten minutes.”
“Haha! You’re a Shirone!”I trust you!”
Nade rushed to the research group, and Shirone, who followed Eruki, returned ten minutes later and picked him up at the front gate.From then on, I ran fast and caught up with Eruki ten minutes later.As they came running, Eruki shook his head with a troubled look on his face.
“That’s strange,”
“Why? Did you miss the teacher?”
“No, but I almost missed it.Strangely enough, they are on guard around them.I thought it was a battlefield.”
“Oh, it’s getting more and more interesting.You’re not going to take money out of the pocket with things that are forbidden like us, are you?”
Cironet looked at Nade pitifully.
“Teachers don’t do that.”
“Well, let’s go for now.From now on, I have a transparent cloak, so I can get closer.”
The three men covered themselves in their cloaks and chased after Siena.When I entered the common people’s area, the streets were crowded with people who came out to do business from the very dawn.Thanks to this, it was easier to follow.
She stopped at a two-story house.The three men leaned out of their cloaks and watched who opened the door.Then she looked around, and her face went in like a turtle.The hearts of the three were pounding.
“You’re on the lookout, aren’t you?”Who in the world lives in this house?It’s just a common house, isn’t it?”
The three curious men reappeared.I didn’t even commit a crime, but I didn’t think I had to be frozen.
A young man opened the door and came out.and as soon as he saw her, he gave her a deep hug.
“Well, how could that be?”…!”
Shirone’s party was shocked, no matter who it was.The nickname “Siena of Ice” refers to her major, but it was also given to her cold nature toward any man.But I can’t believe there was a man who had hidden.Looking back at each other’s faces, the three realized that it was real.
“What’s going on here?”It must have been a man, wasn’t he?
“You’ll find out when you get there.Let’s follow him in.”
said Shirone, in a fit of surprise.
“What? But how can I get into someone else’s house?”
“But it’s a little too much to go back to, isn’t it?”You have to know what you need to know.”
“The teacher is a maiden, so of course I can meet men.Why are you making such a fuss?”
Eruki had a different idea.Judging from the circumstances so far, there were more than one or two strange things.
“I smell something, don’t I?There is nothing wrong with the teacher seeing a man.But why did he hide it?It’s an official solo in school, right?And I’m also concerned about being wary of the surroundings.”
“That’s it,”That’s why I want you to check it out.”
asked Shirone, with a troubled look on his face.
“What are you going to do?”
“You can go through the underground warehouse.Don’t worry about it.Even if you get caught, it’s not a big trouble?After all, Siena has entered the house, and it is no stranger’s house.”
Shirone opened his mouth blankly.
“Isn’t that… very subjective of us?”
“I don’t know. I’m leaving anyway.I’m going crazy with curiosity.”
When Nade and Eruki left, Shirone sighed and followed them.I didn’t like the way they seemed to agree, but I didn’t know what I would do if I left them alone.
Arriving at the entrance to the underground warehouse, Nade looked at the iron gate.It was installed horizontally and tightly locked.
Taking out a device similar to a ballpoint pen from his pocket, he pressed the button and a sharp iron needle popped out.It was a key unlock device, one of Nade’s patented items.
In order to open the lock, it is necessary to accurately press the irregularities of the internal organs, but Nade’s device can adjust the iron core in units of 1/100 centimeters, making it easy to get the level of a commoner’s house.
Nade, who put the device in the lock, looked around with his tongue sticking out, and the moment he turned his wrist, the lock clicked open.
When the door opened and he saw the ladder going underground, Shirone felt dejected.
People spend the night with confidence just because there is a lock, but in the end, they seemed to forget that the lock was also made by humans.
As I climbed down the ladder, the scent of onions peculiar to the grocery store stimulated the tip of my nose.While Shirone closed the iron gate, Nade listened to the door to the first floor and looked outside.
“Well, it’s quiet on the first floor, too.Let’s go up there.”
The three men, covered in transparent cloaks, headed to the first floor looking like ghosts with only their faces floating.The living room and kitchen were all-in-one floors, and there were no people.As I went up the stairs to the second floor, I felt a movement in the room at the end of the corridor.I heard the voice of Siena.
“What are you doing? Hurry up.”
Shirone and Nade moved their facial muscles in a fuss, and Eruki put his hand on their lips.A man’s voice continued.
“Wait a minute. I’m not ready yet.Take off your clothes first.”
“When will your wife come back?”
“I went grocery shopping.It’ll probably take more than two hours.”
Nade could not control his excitement again.No, he had a look of astonishment beyond excitement.
Shirone felt the same way.I never dreamed that the man Mr. Siena met was a married man.

“Aren’t you going to wear it today?”
“Well, straighten your back a little more.”
“Like this?”
“Well, then,”Raise your legs slightly.”Yes, it is that so?”
The faces of the three were flushed red.Of course, since they are adults, the relationship between men and women can work.But it was an affair.When the school became known, the life of a teacher in Siena was over.
“Then shall we begin?”Don’t move.”
“Don’t worry. You’ve been holding it in until now.”
Nade looked back at his friends angrily.Shirone and Eruki nodded as they guessed what he was going to do.
There is no border in love, but considering the feelings of a wife who lost her husband, it was right to end it here.
Nade’s hand was trembling as he grabbed the doorknob.If you wait a little longer, you can complete the on-site inspection, but I didn’t want to see the teacher I respected.
The doorknob turned rough, and the three of them rushed into the room without saying who came first.
“You bad boy!Siena!I’m really disappointed!”
Nade’s cry was buried in silence.
Shirone and Eruki, who were ready to close their eyes, stared at the landscape in a completely different room than they had imagined.
Siena, sitting in bed, turned to the door.There was a large canvas standing across from her.
“Huh? Huh?”
Shirone’s party was all mouth like fish.An idea crossed everyone’s mind.It was an event where great misunderstandings, misunderstandings, and distortions occurred at the same time.
“What? What are you doing here?”…?”
The same was true of Siena, who was surprised.His face flushed when his disciples suddenly entered his private place.But the shame was for a moment, and he soon frowned.
“Did you follow me?”
“What? No, that’s not it.Let me tell you what happened. We were just sitting in the park and spacing out.But Siena suddenly walked by.So… “
“In the end, you followed him, didn’t you?
“I’m sorry!”
Shirone’s party shrank at the same time.In her character, it would not have ended with a scolding.However, contrary to expectations, no more sparks fell.When I opened my eyes, I saw Siena in thought.
“How in the world did you follow me?”’
I tried to be as careful as I could to keep an eye on my surroundings.She didn’t go into the Spirit Zone, but her eyes were not so clumsy as to be followed by students.
“What are you hiding behind you?”Give it to me.”
Nade shook his head with a frightened look.But when something similar to living came out of Siena’s eyes, she hurriedly held out her cloak.Siena, who snatched it violently, looked at her missing arm and looked at it with an absurd.I looked around my waist like a skirt, and this time it was cut off from the waist.
“Nade, is this the patent you’re proud of?””
“Yes,”
“You really made it, didn’
“But I didn’t put it on the black market!”I have that much conscience.”
“Whoo!”
Siena’s sigh shook their shoulders.But she didn’t nag any more.Being followed as a certified sixth-class wizard was more immature than the mistakes of his disciples.
“But why did you come into this room?”Even though you know you’ll get caught.What’s the point of disappointment?”
said Cironet in a trembling voice.
“At first, I followed him as a joke, but when I saw the teacher hugging a man, I followed him in.I overheard a conversation outside the door and thought I was having an affair, so…….”
“What? Boo, affair?”
Siena’s face turned red as a beet.It was the first time that she had shown such a panicky appearance.
“What do you mean an affair? How can you look at me and say that?”
returned Nade, with a flurry of impatience.
“But it is!”How can you not misunderstand after hearing such a conversation?I’d rather take off my clothes than try this posture.”Who the hell is that?”
Nade pointed to the man who was still hiding behind the canvas.
“Do you mean me?”
Following his warm voice, the chair squeaked.After a while, a man appeared over the canvas.
Shirone’s party looked blank.He was a handsome man in his late 20s with blond hair to his waist.But the reason why I was really surprised was not because I was handsome.I could see a rag wrapped around his eyes.He was blind, and he was a painter.
“What is it?”
Shirone’s face turned pale.The sense of portraiture felt every night began to envelop the whole body again.
“What’s wrong with you? Why at such a time?”It’s never been like this during the day.’
His hair stood up and his bones froze.Nade, feeling a little responsibility, said, as he took a long deep breath, holding his shaky wrist.
“Hey, it’s Shirone said.Are you okay? Don’t worry too much.Will the teacher kill us?”
“Huh? Oh, no.I’m all right now.”
Shirone gradually regained his comfortable appearance.It was a tremendous chill that was incomparable to the usual sense of portrait, but as such, the disappearance time was also fast.
“Siena, stop it and forgive me.I don’t know what’s going on, but I think you’re teaching students
“What are you talking about?”That’s why I can’t forgive you any more.Even if it’s a follow-up, you broke into someone else’s house without permission.Anyway, I’ve learned only the bad things like that.
The man smiled benevolently.
“But you’re a disciple.The teacher must have thought it was all right to be at home.”
Nade, who caught the opportunity of a meeting, stepped in.
“Ha-ha! That’s what we actually thought.It’s true. Shirone doesn’t lie, so ask him.I would never have come in if it were just someone else’s house.We are not petty thieves.”
Shirone nodded one after another.
“Yes, indeed, Nade told me so.I’m sure I heard it.”
She touched her head as if she were in trouble.It was even disgusting to see his innocent eyes twinkling to live somehow.
“How can such naive people do this?”Anyway, clever things…….’
It was absolutely not something to say when he followed the teacher hiding in an invisible cloak, and came in after opening the lock of another’s house.
Despite the situation, the man was only smiling.Above all, I was happy to see the disciples of Siena.
“My name is Armin.Shinawa has been like a brother and a sister since childhood.I studied in the Olifer school, too.”
Armin held out his hand and Nade held it together.
“Ah, I see,”We apologize for our foolish misunderstanding.I’m sorry to drop by without notice.”
cried Siena fiercely.
“It’s a break-in!”I’m trying to change it to a door.”
“Hehe. That’s why I said I was sorry.To be honest, we’re happy that the misunderstanding of Mr. Siena has been resolved.”
“I’m sorry, sir,”I had a strange misunderstanding.”
Siena put her hand on her waist and exhaled.It was the same for her that she felt awkward in the situation where she encountered her disciples in a private place, so there was silence for a while.
“For now, sit down and talk.I’ll get the tea first.”
Armin quickly stepped aside.The blind man walked out of the door at the right pace, and Shirone’s party was surprised again.
“Who is that, sir?”And what did you mean by telling me to take off my clothes?That’s why I misunderstood you.”
Siena shook her head as if she had no doubt.
“My brother Armin is of the same age as me.He was also expected to be the greatest genius in the history of the Oliver school.Now I’m a painter, but since I was a child, I’ve been much more talented than I have.”
“You’re a great man, aren’t you?But I don’t know if I should ask you this question, but how come your eyes……?”
As Siena’s face darkened, Nade felt guilty as if he had asked a question.Fortunately, however, she soon relaxed her expression and spoke calmly.
“To save me, my brother lost his eyes.”
“What? Because of you?”
“At the age of nine, I fell into an overflow.I was afraid of everything when I had a vague idea of the world.I think I cried every day.It was a terrible pain to think about now that I think about it.”
Siena smiled bitterly.
“It was Mr. Armin who saved me.It led me to the light in the dark.At that time, Armin was eleven years old.”
Even if she was 11, she was still a child.Nevertheless, saving Siena from overflow was a part of how outstanding Armin was.
“You overcame the overflow with Mr. Armin’s advice.”
Siena shook her head.
“No, I wasn’t such a strong child.He was a proud little boy who lived in favor of the Oliphar family alone.At that time, I hated my brother.He used to talk to me like a habit.I mean, whatever comes to you, you shouldn’t look away from it.Every time that happened, I was annoyed.You close your eyes because you’re scared.I couldn’t stand it, so I had to run away.Whoo-hoo. Come to think of it, I was such a fool then.”
Shirone could not imagine Siena, a certified sixth-class wizard, crying in fear.
“How did you overcome the overflow?”
“I didn’t want him to come and visit me, so I went out to the mountains, the fields, and the river.Armin found me easily, but every time I did that, I ran away again.One day when the game of hide and seek continued….and the incident broke out.”
Siena frowned painfully.
“It rained for a few days during the rainy season.I walked around the river on such a bad day.Come to think of it, it might have gone by like that.Unfortunately, however, the bank that was blocking the upstream collapsed.I, who was downstream, was swept away by the river without knowing anything.It was such a flood that it flooded half of the town.”
Siena recalled what happened 17 years ago.
I couldn’t even scream and fell into the river.When I struggled to get up, it was a completely different view from the river where she was already.Building debris and livestock were floating upstream, and sharply broken trees were floating downstream.
Siena experienced the fear of death for the first time in her life.
“Save me. Somebody please……!’
I know that no one is coming.Far from the school, this place was in the middle of a stream and swamp where people did not appear.It’s a river now, but no one would think that a little girl would be here.
The water quickly swelled up.The land seemed so far away that the wading was impossible.The silgaecheon Stream, which used to go to pick up pebbles, turned into a large 25-meter-wide torrent.The color of the water was black, and as the current cracked in the rock, numerous vortexes were formed.
“Help me! Somebody help me!”
For the first time in her life, Siena made a humble appearance.The pride of being the only daughter of Oliver, one of the ten major continental schools, lost her authority in the face of Mother Nature.Even his natural talent could not overcome the raging river.All she could do was cry for help.
“Siena!”
As she heard God’s revelation, she raised her head with all her might.Armin was waiting on a precariously curved branch over the river.
“Hey! Hey!”
“Give me your hand!”
Armin reached near the surface of the water.As soon as Siena tried to hold his hand, she was swept away by the sudden stone water and submerged into the water.
“Siena!”
When Siena reappeared, her legs, not her face, were floating.Armin was obtained without delay.He quickly dived on the swift current, caught Siena, and pulled her face out of the water.Siena, who drank water, was out of her mind.
“Poo-ha! Poo-ha!”
“Siena! Wake up!We have to get out of the river!”
“Save me! Save me!”
The whirlpool was out of the way, but there were more rugged obstacles waiting.Armin expanded the Spirit Zone to avoid obstacles.It was the only way he could do it at the age of 11.

“Siena! Open your eyes!Pull yourself together!”
“Brother! Buy, save……!”
Siena was not in a state of calm.However, it was impossible to wade with the physical abilities of two young people.Armin realized that he had to do it by himself.
“All you have to do is go to the Delpons.”From that point on, it’s a delta, so the quantity will decrease.At the current rate, we should be there in about 20 minutes.’
Twenty minutes? It was a long way off.Can I take Siena, who is unconscious, and endure 20 minutes in the torrent?
“What a fool. I have no choice but to do it.”’
Armin came to his senses.I felt a strange distortion of the scene before me.Broken logs were coming down.I twisted my body with all my might.He moved with reality, whether the old man got into his eyes, when a huge rock hit him, or when a sharp tree cut through his skin.
“A little more… A little more!”
I could feel the tiny hands of Siena pinching her waist.The feeling of a fragile life relying on itself was miserable, but a greater sense of mission awakened the mind.
After a hell of a time, the destination began to be seen in the distant downstream.But there was no way to get there.A tree broken toward the river was blocking the road.
“Listen, Siena,”We must avoid that.In order to do that, you have to go into the water.My brother will press you.Hold your breath and go up again.Do you understand?”
“Older brother! I’I can’t do it!”
“You have to. You can do it.Trust me!”
“Hey! Oh…!”
When the two vortexes entered the combined area, the speed of the torrent more than doubled.Unexpectedly, Armin bit his molar.The flood of garbage came like a monster with only a floating view of the neck.
Armin gave himself a cramp in his foot.Sharp things scratched through my body.He continued to bleed and his body temperature dropped, making him unconscious.In the meantime, I arrived at a tree that was blocking the road.Looking at it from a close point, there was no other way but to get into the water.
“Siena! I’m going!”
Armin glared at the approaching tree and timed it.Then he pressed her shoulder just before the crash.
“Now!”
The screaming voice of Siena was drowned in the water.The sharp epidermis of the wet wooden doong expanded in the field of view of Armin, which rose while pressing Siena.But his whole nerves were concentrated on the hand that weighed down Siena.Then, the moment she walked under the wooden porch, she relaxed.
“Done! I succeeded!”
Armin smiled faintly and looked at the woodpecker approaching him.I was glad to have saved Siena.And until that moment, he didn’t close his eyes.
“Older brother!”
The voice of Siena drifting downstream was faintly heard.
That’s where the story of Siena ended.The children bowed their heads solemnly.
“I was rescued by the villagers as I drifted all the way to the Delpons.There was no dangerous structure thanks to my departure from the forest, and my brother, who fainted, was carried away to where I was.The school dispatched people for treatment, but the diagnosis was permanent eye damage.My brother has lost his sight since then.”
“Well, that’s the story for you two.”….”
“My brother taught me how to overcome fear.Thanks to you, I was able to overcome the overflow.But my brother lost his light.The greatest talent in school history……that’s how it stopped.”
Shirone was heartbroken.It is no exaggeration to say that almost all human eyes are lost.You can’t read books, and learning magic is bound to be a limitation.I could tell without seeing how disappointed and distressed he must have been.
“When I heard that my brother had come here three years ago, I met him.They are developing a style of painting that draws light.That’s why I volunteered to be a model.”
“I see. We didn’t know that, and we misunderstood it for no reason.”….”
It was rude of them to misunderstand their relationship as an affair.Just as the atmosphere was getting dark, Armin came with tea and refreshments.
“Did I disturb you?”It’s rare for Siena to bring up old things.”
“Older brother,”
“First of all, let’s get in the car.It’s not a good thing, but it’s got my wife’s secret in it, so I think it’s
“Oh, thank you for the meal.”
Shirone’s party received the tea cup in a grateful manner.He is said to have turned into a painter, but he has shown a genius for magic 20 years ago.They could blame their unfortunate fate, but they, aspiring wizards, could not underestimate Armin.
Armin, who returned to the canvas, offered a seat behind him.
“Well, then I’ll have to work on it, too.Would you please wait here?”
“Oh, yes, of course.”
The three of them, with their teacups in their hands, moved about in a little awkwardly.asked Nade, glancing at her as she got into position in bed.
“I’m sorry to ask you this question, but you’re not drawing a nudity, are you?”
Knowing that Armin was a painter, it was none of his business to do any art.However, I thought it would be difficult for Siena to do so in front of her disciples.
“Hahaha! No matter how blind you are, you can’t ask your beloved sister too much.”
“But I heard earlier that you wanted to take off your clothes…….”
“Oh, that’s it.Siena, will you show me?”
She opened the closet and took out a silver-foil coat.It was so dazzling that it was difficult to even look at it as the light reflected.said Shirone, covering his hand.
“Wow! It’s very bright.”
“Because you can’t see things exactly on the spirit zone alone.You can feel the light by putting a light-emitting body on a person or object.In that sense, foil coats are a very good tool.”
“It’s unique. You paint because you feel the light.”
“Instead of losing your eyes, you can paint what other artists can’t draw.But today is the last time I’m drawing a cina.I have a good sponsor and I have to move in a few days.So I wanted to make use of the original feeling of poetry.for I feel my beauty fade in my coat.”
Siena’s cheeks turned slightly red.
“You’re so…`That’s ridiculous,’
“Ha-ha! So what?”You are still a nine-year-old boy in my head.”
“All right, let’s get to work.When Keira gets back, he can’t even work.”
Shirone’s party wiggled their fingers and toes in a subtle, ticklish air.It is clear that they are like brothers and sisters, but that did not mean they were blood-related.Perhaps the reason why Siena reacted more violently than usual to the word “infidelity” was that she still had a slight lingering attachment to Armin.
“Well, let’s get started.I’ll finish earlier than usual, because I’ll draw it as I feel.”
When Siena had settled down, Armin took the charcoal and began to outline it.Shirone’s party, watching from the back, admired his skills.Even though it seemed to be drawn roughly, the lines were drawing the outline of Siena.
“Wow! That’s amazing.”
“Hush,”
Eruki raised his index finger and warned Nade.Being blind is a fatal disadvantage for an artist, so it would require more concentration than usual.
But Shirone tilted his head.It was really strange.Even though there was no luminescence, Armin was accurately transferred to the canvas, even to the fine features of Siena.
“How is this possible?”Does it mean that the spirit zone is that dense?Even so, this detail is…….’
If the spirit zone has considerable density, precise description may be possible through synesthesia.It was the same principle as footprints on mud.But I understand that even Jonah Ethella has not reached that level.
The picture has become more precise.Siena had a beautiful smile that was rarely seen at school.Armin used bread like an eraser to perfectly embody the smile on the canvas.
Shirone exclaimed in his heart.I heard that one of the most difficult things for an artist to express is his lips.This is because the feeling changes according to subtle changes in the corners of the mouth.
“I see. This is impossible.’
No matter how dense the spirit zone was, it didn’t make sense for a blind artist to catch this.When I thought so, I got goosebumps and my sense of portrait came back to life.
“Well… Mr. Armin,”
“What?”
Armin smiled and turned his head slightly.Shirone wondered for a moment if he could ask such a question.If I had made a mistake, I would have done him a great disrespectful.
“Is it perhaps Mr. Armin?”….”
But I couldn’t stand it without asking.The cool chill of the portrait penetrated my bones.
“Can’t you see my eyes?”
Armin’s still smiling hand stopped.He laid down the charcoal calmly, and looked back at Shirone and said,
“Yes, I can see it.”
Shirone was speechless.Are you really saying that you can see my eyes?But why didn’t Siena know?
Armin, who had completely turned to Shirone, loosened the cloth covering his eyes.A number of wounds were engraved around the closed eyes.
“It’s obvious that you’re hurt, but how can you see it?”No, I was covering my eyes from the beginning.But what do you mean by “seeing”?….’
“You must have a lot of questions for me.I’ll show it to you myself.”
As Armin opened his eyes slowly, Shirone stopped breathing.There were no pupils.It was not to be called a minister, but the empty orbitals were filled with bright lights.
“Yes, Nade, Lucky!”Can you see that? Huh?
Shirone slapped Nade on the thigh in a hurry.However, the feeling of being conveyed through the hands was strange.firmness as if touching something.Turning his head to look at his friends, he sprang to his feet with a startled look on his face.
“No way!How?”
Nade didn’t even budge.Eruki was also looking at the canvas with a smile on his face.He hurried over and examined Siena, but the same was true.He was just there, stiff as a wax figure.Armin approached the confused Shirone’s back.
“It’s been a long time since I had a visitor in my room.”
“No way, it’s……?”
“Yes, that’s right.It’s a magic called stop.”
Shirone turned away with a stunned look.Stop is a magic that can only be done by magicians who use light speed, and those who have reached this level throughout history have been selected.In short, he was experiencing the absolute state of time magic.
“Sit down. Let’s talk calmly.There’s plenty of time.”
“Haha…”
Shirone smiled awkwardly.Certainly, if time had stopped, time could be said to be infinite.
“In fact, I was nervous while painting.I don’t know when Shirone will come into the station at this time.”
“How did you know that I would notice?”
Armin pointed to the light embedded in the orbital.
“The eye accepts light and reconstructs it into visual information.But without eyes, I feel the world by the light itself.This is quite a terrible experience.The forms of things that ordinary people perceive seem completely different to me.”
“It’s an idea, isn’t it?”
There is no guarantee that the human senses will accept the truth.Perhaps bricks are as soft as jelly.The fire was cold, and the sweet kiss of the lover might be accompanied by pain.
“Let me give you a proper introduction.I’m Armin in the mine.He is a wizard who is called a reflection of eternity among acquaintances.”
“But when Mr. Armin was a child, he used magic…….”
“Yes, it was an unfortunate accident.I left the Olifer school and wandered aimlessly for 15 years.A world full of darkness.”

Armin recalled those days.
“Not being able to see is like losing space.As the space disappeared, so did the time.Then I realized it in the dark.The fact that the existence of the country is already out of time.That’s how the stop magic was completed.”
Shirone’s heart fluttered.I felt like I heard the essence of stop magic that the wizards couldn’t conquer for many hours.
“You don’t have to be so impressed.It’s not a particularly transcendent ability.It’s only possible within the radius of the Spirit Zone, and it’s very limited.”
Armin looked back at the frozen Siena in time.
“He’s a good brother.He is as soft-hearted as he pretends to be strong.Do you think so, Shirone?”
“Ha ha! Well, I don’t know if he’s soft, but he’s definitely a good guy.”
“What do you think now?”Is my sister beautiful?”
“Well, of course he is.It’s popular at school, too.”
“Then what?”Can we do something strange while the time is stopped?”
Shirone, who understood Armin’s words, blushed.
“What are you talking about?”Am I right, Mr. Armin?….”
“Don’t worry about it.It’s impossible.Currently, we are in a state where the mass converges to zero.If there is no actual mass, it will be dismantled, but the point is acceleration.That’s why stop magic is called the area of light speed.”
“That’s why Nade was so hard when he touched her.I couldn’t even fold my collar because I didn’t have any mass.”
“That’s right. It’s infinitely weak.But it is true that no one can touch us.That’s the real meaning of stop magic.How did you know I would notice?It’s simple, because I also had the same enlightenment as Shirone.”
“If it’s the same realization…–I don’t think so.”
“Yes. It’s an Immortal Function.”
Shirone’s heart pounded.There is a person in front of me who has experienced an Immortal Function that no one has given me an answer.It was also the highest wizard in the time series.
“Emotions are realizations of the essence.Since the essence is one, the wavelength between Shirone and me resonates.It’s also called a sense of portraiture.”
“What’s an Immortal function?”
“It’s a gateway to infinity.Shirone opened it up.In magic society, these people are called “unlockers.”
Armin, who had been thinking for a while, asked a question.
“Didn’t you feel the ego disintegrating when you opened the mobile function?”
“That’s right! I thought I was really disappearing then.”
“If it had lasted, it would have,”When the mind transcends the end of the number, the spirit zone expands infinitely.But humans are finite beings.That’s why unlockers accept infinity through their own spirit zones.”
Shirone, who heard the explanation, said with a tearful face.
“What should I do?”Even the best wizards were careful, but I didn’t know anything at the time.Perhaps that’s why I have nightmares every night, and I feel a sense of portraiture when I’m alone.”
Armin relieved Shirone with a gentle smile.
“Of course it is.If you could control it from the beginning, you wouldn’t have opened the Immortal Function.The sense of portraiture is what Shirone feels to himself.for I still don’t know what enlightenment I’ve gained from the great expansion.”
“How can I know?”
“You’ll realize it on your own.It’s just that you can’t name what you already got.”
“But…”
Seeing Shirone, with a troubled face, Armin recalled his former self.Indeed, no matter how much you say that you will realize it on your own, it could not have felt real.
“Well, then I’ll tell you,”What Shirone realized was that it was called gauge symmetry.”
“Gauge… symmetry?”
“The world must be perfectly balanced.But in reality, the symmetry is broken.Shirone experienced the separation firsthand.That’s probably the cause of the sense of portraiture.”
Shirone continued to recite the word gauge symmetry as a spell.But something magically didn’t come to mind.
said Armin, stroking Shirone’s head.
“You don’t have to worry about anything.I don’t mean to say nothing, but Shirone’s army will eventually arrive.Then you will understand what I mean.”
Shirone took a deep breath and nodded.My mind is not yet organized, but I could see that today’s meeting would be a huge turning point in my future.
“Thank you very much.If I hadn’t met Mr. Armin, I might have been in an overflow, as Siena said.”
“Unlockers are as close to each other as they share the same wavelength.Of course, that bond sometimes turns into a big fight.I’m glad you’ve been of some help.”
Armin looked back at Siena with a friendly smile.
“I think it’s time to leave the Time Room.I have to finish the painting before my wife comes back.”
“Oh, come to think of it, you said today was the last day, right?”
“Yes, I have a great name, but first of all, I’m a painter.Starting today, I’m going to pack up and leave in a few days.You won’t be able to see her for a while.”
“I’d rather tell the doctor…….”
Armin shook his head.
“Siena is still suffering.Even if I didn’t give up my magic, it wouldn’t bring back my lost eyes.Besides, I’m already married.I want to help her live her life.”
Shirone understood Armin’s feelings.I don’t want to see my younger brother who cares more about his life being tied up in the past.
“Yes, I’ll keep it a secret, too.Thank you very much for today.”
“I enjoyed myself, too.It’s Shirone.”
Armin covered his eyes again with a cloth.As he turned to the canvas, time began to go by.Nade and Eruki’s breaths were heard, and Siena’s smile rekindled her life.
Shirone felt as if he had woken up from a dream.I couldn’t believe I had a conversation with Armin just now.
Time flew by in high spirits.Armin, who completed the painting, turned the canvas back to Siena.
“What do you think? Do you think it came out well?”
“Yes, it’s beautiful,”
“You’ve had a hard time.It was an honor to paint you.”
“My brother. We’re not strangers.”….”
A feeling of regret flashed through Siena’s eyes.Then, when I heard footsteps downstairs, I stood up in a fit of surprise, before I could say goodbye.Is it already time for your wife to come back?It was faster than usual, but I wasn’t in the mood to think deeply.
“Well, I’ll be going now.Come on out, you guys.”
Siena tried to leave as if she were running away.At school, Shirone’s party was upset when she was more confident than anyone else, scared just because Armin’s wife was coming.
“Honey, are you drawing?”
Keira leaned forward.Contrary to expectations that she would be as calm as Armin’s personality, she was a cheerful woman in her early 20s.Her eyes met hers and she looked surprised.
“Oh, Ms. Siena?”Now that you mention it, it’s the day you’
“Good morning, Mr. Keira,”It’s been a long time.”
“I know. Why is it so hard to see your face?”You’re not avoiding me on purpose, are you?Whoo-hoo!
Siena seized her confused mind.
“Oh, I’m done with my brother.I’m going to go now.”
“I’m here. What’s the hurry?”Have dinner and go.”
“Thank you for your word, but I have an appointment…….”
“Hmm. This is suspicious.Honey, did you do anything suspicious with her when I wasn’t there?”
“Be careful what you say, Keira,”
Armin’s forehead was wrinkled.Shirone thought there was no such thing.The teacher was careful from beginning to end, but he said it was suspicious.
Siena, whose face was flushed, walked out of the room as if she were wearing a coat.Shirone’s party, who was upset, glanced at Keira and followed him.However, Kayla smiled and waved her hand, whether she had no sense or was feeling well-intentioned.
“Good-bye, little ones,”Next time you come, I’ll make you something delicious.”
Of course, no answer came back.Keira tilted her head and muttered in their cold manner.
“Oh, what mistake did I make?”What’s wrong with your expressions?”Did you really do something weird here?”
“Stop fooling around and come down.I want to say hello properly.”
“Well, if it’s your sister, she’s crazy.”
Armin quickly went down the stairs.She was waiting outside the door, perhaps not feeling well at this rate.
“I’m sorry, Siena,”My wife is very talkative.”
“It’s all right. I don’t know when we’ll see each other again if we break up.”Take care of yourself.Stay healthy.”
“Well, you do your best, too.Still, my brother is relieved to see that he is on good terms with his students.Honestly, I was worried if I could do well.Hahaha!”
Siena burst into a smirk.There must be only Armin in the world who can treat himself as a child.He was the only one who shared memories of his immature childhood.
Shirone was touched.Now it was vaguely understood why the genius of the kingdom had decided to become a teacher, why he was so obsessed with overflow, and why he had kept away from men even when he was nicknamed “Siena of Ice.”
“Then I’ll go,”Let me know if you have time.”
“Well, I’ll see you when I’m settled.and Shirone, Nade, and Eruki.Do your best.I’ll hear your names from far away, if you’ve grown into great wizards.”
“Yes. I’m sorry about today.”
Shirone’s party expressed their sincere thanks.Without Armin’s consideration, things would not have ended so safely.
Armin remained there until the appearance of Siena disappeared.Then Keira, leaning against the door, folded her arms, said with a cold look.
“Armin, get a hold of yourself.I don’t know what will happen if I find myself up there in the air.”
Armin turned to Keira with a displeased look.She lived in disguise as a married couple for three years, but she was really unfriendly.
“No matter how I feel, it’s up to me.Just give me a mission report.Have you finished your investigation?”
“Perfect. There’s nothing more to see in Creas.I have to go to Calvera in the next 15 days.You have to go through a dangerous area, but there’s no problem with the armin in the mine, is there?”
“You don’t have to talk too much.I’ll keep my promise.”
said Armin flatly, but Keira was not relieved.Although selected from the top with excellent insight and genius magic skills, he was a freewheeling man who could leave the organization at any time.
“You didn’t tell her, did you?”
Armin did not answer.
“I don’t want to harm you.Of course, I know that there is no way to capture a reflection of eternity, but you are still a human being.The moment you betray your organization, everyone you love will experience hell.Not only the Synaes, but also the Oleifer school.”
It was a frightening threat, and it was true.The organization to which Keira belongs had enough power, power, and cruelty to survive.
No matter what happens, you have to keep the city.In that sense, I was lucky to meet Shirone.Today’s variable, which no one expected, will someday lead to an advantage.
“You don’t have to worry,”
said Armin, smiling as he looked back at Keira.
“Siena doesn’t know anything.”
In the moonlight, Siena (1)
As they returned to school, Shirone’s party looked anxiously at Shirona’s countenance.
The atmosphere was fine when she was with Armin, but she never knew when she would change her mind.

[59] Siena (2) under the moonlight
But without saying a word, Siena was just looking down at the ground.
Shirone felt heavy at the sight of her depressed self.
Had it not been for an accident in his childhood, he could have developed into a good relationship with Armin.
But I couldn’t blame Armin for suddenly getting married.He left Siena on his own to relieve his beloved sister’s guilt.
Nade grumbled as if he didn’t like it.
“Well, I know a man and a woman, but I don’t know.”
“I can’t do it,”Not everything in the world goes its way.”
“You’ve been so cold at school, and honestly, I don’t want to see that.”
Nade, who was angry with his fists clenched, moved quickly and approached Siena.
“Teacher,”
“Huh?”
“We’re hungry.Now that I’ve come out, please buy me a meal.”
Siena put an absurd look on her face.Today’s home invasion they committed was not enough to be disciplined by the school.I can’t believe you asked me to buy you a meal in such a situation.
“You’re very fast-paced,”Do you eat in this situation?”
“What’s the matter with you asked.Even if you’re disciplined, you’ll have to fill your stomach.You learn magic to make ends meet anyway.”
Shirone interrupted.
“Yes, sir,”Eat before you go home.I’m hungry, too.”
said Eruki.
“In that sense, one suggestion would be that we should go into the aristocracy first.The school is close by anyway, and I know a very delicious and expensive restaurant there.”
Siena’s motivation to be annoyed disappeared.The disciples’ attitudes were natural, but I vaguely guessed why they were doing this.She also didn’t want to go back to school in this mood.Anyway, today is a holiday.
“All right, I see.You must have been tired from doing bad things, so let’s eat first.But when you get back to school, you’ll have to be prepared.”
“Hehe! Yes!”
Nade winked back at his friends.The primary purpose is to relieve Siena’s mood, but he also calculated the room to take time to ease the disciplinary action.
The aristocratic district was lined with all kinds of luxurious shops.Eruki took Siena to the most brilliant store.In front of the six-story building, Shirone opened his mouth wide.
The entrance was different from the beginning as the well-known aristocrats attended.A pillar carved from the whole white shark supported the balcony ceiling, and marble carved into a fantastic deity guarded the left and right sides like a prayer.
Restaurant Gold Cupid.
It was a top-notch restaurant with a premium on all foods.
“Wow! I’ve never been here before.It must be a great day today.Shirone, let’s get in here.”
“Oh? Well, you know…….”
Shirone examined Siena.As expected, he looked up at the sign with a rotten smile.It was the most expensive restaurant in the neighborhood, so it was understandable.Above all, Eruki couldn’t have chosen such a restaurant without thinking of peeling off the teacher.
But she didn’t get angry.Rather, he sighed as if he could not, and entered the entrance coolly.
“Well, let’s eat here.”
“Oh, my teacher!”As expected, the distribution is extraordinary!”
Eruki joined Nade’s flattery.
“What a fool. It is difficult to judge the teacher’s distribution so much.If you’re a certified sixth-class wizard, you can go in and out of this shop like a toilet.Don’t you think so, sir?”
“All right, let’s just get in there.Instead, I’ll just eat and go straight to school.”
Shirone, which is the first restaurant dedicated to aristocrats, was surprised by the scale that was revealed from the threshold.The size seen from the outside and the size seen from the inside were completely different as if they were magic.
The table was so sparse that I thought it was a waste of space, and on one side was a bar decorated with various crystal lights.
Naturally, the guests were aristocrats, and it was clear from the jewelry they wore that they were popular in Creas.
“It’s Shirone! This way!”
Shirone, who was enraptured, went to the table at the sound of his friends calling him.Nade and Eruki looked around from time to time, but there was no sign of nervousness.
The waiter approached and took the order.He had a greasy impression of swallowing hair, but when his eyes toward Siena were quite sticky, Shirone’s party was quite displeased.
In school, they are teachers and students, but outside, men must escort women.However, the waiter did not even care about the students, but only looked at Siena.
“Welcome, sir,”Thank you for visiting Gold Cupid.Especially when such a beautiful woman visits the store herself, I don’t know what to do.”
To the extent that it was possible to say that Shirone and his party were deliberately ignored.
“Well, you said it was a top-of-the-line restaurant. How did you train the staff?”I’m not sure if you’d be interested in a flirt like you.’
Nade’s stomach was boiling.His gaze swept through the menu’s price list.Order the most expensive food.I was going to give a punch to a waiter who treated me like a child.
Without thinking, Eruki ordered one course meal after another.Nade, who gained momentum, ordered another course meal.
Shirone was still struggling.In fact, they were all menus I didn’t know.How do you know if braised olaris is meat, fish, or monster tongue?
However, he calmly ordered the same thing as Nade, as he would not be left out.I was worried about the menu that Eruki ordered.
The waiter’s face gradually turned pale as a series of menus served only to VIPs appeared.The first thing that came to mind was whether they could afford to pay.All foods have a premium, but the menu at the lowest price and the highest price is more than three times different.If children who are ignorant of the world were mistaken, there could have been a situation in which they had to pay 12 times the expected price.
The waiter looked anxiously at her.But she was choosing her menu as if she didn’t care.
“I’d like a Dascaux course, please.A bottle of limoness, please.”
She doesn’t enjoy drinking, but sometimes she drinks cognac when she’s feeling down.Limunes was a distilled water with a subtle vanilla scent, and it was popular with women because it was expensive but had a good aftertaste.
“Oh, sir, will you drink?”
“There’s no reason not to, is there?””You’re going into someone else’s house, and I can’t even drink?”
Nade smiled awkwardly.
“Ha-ha. That’s true.Oh, right! You were off duty today, weren’t you?”
When the waiter turned around with his tongue out, Shirone’s party exchanged glances and grinned.But as reason returned gradually, their eyes were filled with anxiety.When I thought all four of them ordered a course meal, the price tag came to my mind.I was worried that I might have given her a useless opportunity at last, but Siena looked insignificant.
The income of certified sixth-class wizards is also in the top 10 percent of aristocratic societies.Furthermore, as he worked at the Alpeas School of Magic, one of the five most prestigious schools in the kingdom, he was able to fully enjoy his life without touching the financial resources of the Oliver school.
“That’s a very successful life,””My teacher,”
It’s not a life of chasing money, but a life of chasing dreams.However, Shirone, the son of a mountain goon, knew better than anyone else that it was not as easy as it sounds.
There were four course meals, so the food kept coming to the table.The people sitting at the other table glanced at me with bored faces.
Shirone and his friends were eager to steal each other’s food without caring.Nade and Eruki were aristocrats, and Shirone was also well versed in table manners, but among his friends, dignity was of no use.
Forks and knives were flying over the table, but Siena was just smiling at her students who were enjoying themselves.
When I was full and the flavor was reduced, I talked about magic like a student at a magic school.It was a pleasant and useful occasion for Siena, too.Nade’s strategy worked, as he could not stop laughing and his gloomy mood was relieved.
“Hehehe. Sir, I’ll give you a drink to the teacher whom this disciple of Bulcho respects.”
“Hmph! You think I’ll cut you some slack?”I’m not saying anything because it’s a place to eat.Be prepared when you get home.”
“Yes, yes, there is no such thing as that.Here you go.”
Nade’s excellent fellowship shone even in such an occasion.Siena didn’t seem to dislike it, but she received alcohol as she was given.Cognac was quite a strong drink, and Siena asked anxiously.
“Teacher, aren’t you eating too much?”
“Hoo-hoo, it’s all right.I don’t mind this much.”
“Of course, he’s an authorized sixth-degree wizard, and he’s not the only one who’ll lose to alcohol.”
Nade was positive about whatever Siena said.He was ready to believe that the fork was a trident.
“What? You’re so desperate.But it’s really okay.I’m a strong drinker.”
With Shirone’s concerned gaze, Shirona turned the strong liquor straight again.
One hour later.
“Hey, you! I mean you!Nade.”
“Yes, sir,”
Siena, who raised her elbows on the table where the tableware had been removed, limped with a flushed face.On the other hand, Shirone’s party stood upright and sweated coldly.
In an hour, a bottle of cognac came to the bottom.
Siena’s tongue was twisted and her eyes slightly lost focus.Shirone’s party, unable to even turn their heads, exchanged glances only with their eyes moving.
“I’m in trouble. The teacher is drunk.”
Siena, who was muttering something in a low voice, suddenly bowed her head.Cerra Nade grabbed her arm in a hurry, falling off the chair.
“Are you all right, sir?”It’s time to go home.”
“You troublemaker!”
Siena, who raised her head, pulled Nade’s ball mercilessly.Nade was dragged away with a painful look on his cheek that stretched like glutinous rice.
“Ouch! It hurts!”
“I mean, listen to me.I want to be a good teacher like Mr. Ethella.Don’t be distracted by strange things and study hard.”
“Yes! Yes, sir!”It really hurts!”
“And Shirone, Eruki,”You guys!”
“Yes!”
Shirone and Eruki stretched their already upright waist and took a close, angled posture.
“So are you, too.I won’t forgive you if you just trust your talent and try to be slow.It doesn’t matter if you think you’re a bad teacher.I won’t forgive you.”
“No one thinks it’s bad.So get a hold of yourself.”
“Whoosh. Yeah, I know that.Why did I buy it and suffer so much?”Well,”
Siena’s eyelids were half closed and her head fell off.Then he ended up burying his face on the table with his feet as pillows.
“Teacher, do you have to get a hold of yourself?””Teacher? I haven’t even calculated yet.”
“I’m sleepy. I’m going to bed.”
“Teacher?”
Siena didn’t answer back.
Nade looked back at his friends with a blank look on his face.However, there was no way that they could be able to take countermeasures.As I was struggling to overcome the difficulties, two men, who were watching from the other table, walked over.
“You’re very drunk, aren’t you?”Shall we have the cab stand by?”
A handsome young man spoke to Siena.Behind him was a Honam-type man with a sly smile.
The eyes of Shirone’s party were cold at the same time.I’ve been aware of it since I came in here.that they had been watching her from the beginning and making lewd remarks.
“Teacher? Sir,”Please pull yourself together.”
The best thing to do was to wake her up as soon as possible and get out.However, I thought I was going to put my upper body up, but I couldn’t stand it and fell down on the table again.The man who caught the word teacher in Nade’s words glistened his eyes and flirted.

===============================
[60] Siena (3) under the moonlight
“Aha! You’re an educator, aren’t you?”Nice to meet you. My name is Cossain Silver, the fourth member of the aristocracy.My father is a clerk in Creas.With all due respect, I fell in love at first sight.It would be an infinite honor if you could give me the good fortune to take me home.”
Siena wriggled up her upper body.Instead of looking at Silver, however, he supported his forehead with both hands and sighed.
“Sigh, I’m sorry to bother you,”I wanted to get a little drunk today.’
It seems that only bad things happen today.Aren’t you weak by your disciples, ignored by Keira, and now even strange men are sticking together?
There was a bitter smile on the lips of Siena, who thought so.Maybe it’s just like a woman who’s broken up now.
“Hoo-hoo. But there are people who say I’m good.”A woman like me with a cruel personality and a heartless heart.”
I’ve never felt love for anyone.When Armin appeared with Keira three years ago, he didn’t feel betrayed.But there seemed to be some expectation.I wonder what it would be like to see them again.But can it really be called love?
“I’ve introduced myself too grandly.I’m sorry about this.I met a woman who I never wanted to miss, so I wanted to look good.If it’s rude, I hope you’ll forgive me.”
“It’s all right. I’m tired, so please go.”
Siena was really tired.Of course, it is not difficult to sober up with the spirit of a certified sixth-class wizard, but the unrealistic haze of alcohol was still needed.
“It’s not chivalry to leave a woman alone.I’ll take you to the carriage.Lean on me.”
When Silver seized her by the shoulder and tried to help her, Shirone’s party immediately protested.
“What are you doing?”Don’t mess with the teacher.”
“There seems to be some misunderstanding, and I’m going to take you there.”It’s none of your children’s business, so you should go home now.I’ll just have to take the coach.”
Silver tried to help her by force.Then Shirone seized him by the wrist.In front of Siena, Silver’s face, who was a good sheep, was instantly distorted.Being ignored by a woman can be tolerated for a desired purpose.However, his pride was not acceptable to be treated like this by a child.
“Hey, you insolent little thing,”Where did you learn this?Let go of this hand when you speak nicely.”
“The teacher said no.Please leave now.We’ll take care of you, sir.”
“Because the little ones are so cute.I saw earlier that you were the ones who made me drink. Do you know what you’re up to?Where’s your school?Do you all want to be expelled?”
Shirone’s face turned cold.The reason for bringing up the school was to pressure Siena.This is because if a teacher causes an accident in such a place, he or she will be talked about.
said Eruki.
“In conclusion, you’ve been looking this way for a while.I don’t think it’s your business, then.And just to tell you one more thing, the teacher here isn’t the kind of person you are.”
“You? Did you just call me you?”
“Then I’ll call you you, what do you call yourself?”Should I call him a pervert?
“You brat!”
Silver turned his drunkenness into anger and grabbed Eruki by the collar.However, as soon as he felt a tingling sensation in his side, his hands lost strength.The impression of Silver crept back, clutching his stomach.
“What’s this?”
Nade was generating electricity from the palm of his hand.
“Get out of here. I’ll break your bottom next time.”
A Honam-type man, who was waiting to use force, approached Silver with a serious look on his face.
“Hey, they’re students of the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
“Magic School? Alpeas Magic School?”
Silver’s expression wasn’t good either.The magic school was different from the school attended by ordinary aristocrats.Furthermore, the Alpeas Magic School was one of the five most prestigious kingdoms in the country.
Silver rolled his eyes and focused on figuring out what was going on, and Eruki laughed and approached him.
“I hear you’re going to kick us out of school?”
“No, it’s…….”
“I’m MERCODINE Eruki.If you can kick me out of school, feel free to do so.”
“Me, mercodyne?”
I felt like I was all sober.No matter how provincial Crayas was, no one of the nobles in the Kingdom of Tormia did not know the surname Mercodine.
Of course, it was the first class of aristocrats, and it was the best literacy family that had never been deprived of the head of the king’s advisory body, “Yongneung,” for hundreds of years.
Silver’s pupils shook in a hurry, and Yiruki looked displeased as if he knew it.Wherever you go, there are so-called “family members” nobles.Nevertheless, the reason for scaring Silver in a hateful manner was to protect Siena.I know he has no guts to play tricks, but I cut him off because I might harm him by taking advantage of his weakness as a teacher.Of course, I didn’t think she would be shaken by this much, as an Olipharist.
“Let’s go, Silver,”Hey, Silver!”
The Honam man pulled Silver’s arm.Silver also thanked his friend for saving his face, and ran away with his tail off.After they had disappeared, Shirone’s party was still angry.It was obvious that they had no regard for themselves, given that they had played a trick on Siena.He must have looked even more ridiculous because he was so small.
“The water here is terribly bad.You can’t tell just by looking at the sign.Let’s not come again.”
“Well, let’s get out of here anyway.It’s getting dark, too.
“Teacher, are you all right?”
“Well, it’s all right.Let’s go now.”
Siena, supported by Nade, struggled to get up.She was annoyed by the sudden twisted flies, but she was not in a bad mood.What is there to be afraid of when his disciples are protecting him?Even a certified sixth-class wizard was only one woman outside who was accustomed to being escorted according to the laws of the aristocracy.
Suddenly the disciples looked cute.gladly calculated for dinner, she stumbled out of the door.
There was a moon in the sky.
As the moonlight poured down from the cloudless sky, Siena let out a sigh of joy.
I felt strangely good.Maybe it’s because of alcohol, but maybe it’s a new leap forward today.I felt that I could live my life for the first time out of the shadow of Armin.Maybe it’s because of alcohol, but…….
“Oh, I feel good.I’m very happy today.”
She looked up at the moon like a girl and spun round and round.Shirone’s party, who had just left the store, opened their mouths blankly.
Did alcohol melt her frozen heart for a while?
With her purple hair untied, she was beautiful in the moonlight.It was also fun to see the trench coat unfold like an umbrella.People wandering the streets at night turned to her, but no one was kicking their tongues or frowning.
That’s how lovely Siena was.
Shirone’s party didn’t want to stop him.Rather, I watched with interest the drunkenness that I had never seen before.
“That’s what you’re like, sir.This is unexpected.
“Maybe… we’ve got a scoop?”
Eruki’s eyes flashed and heaps of thoughtful.
“Well, you mean it could be used as a weapon, right?”Weapons that can prevent the dissolution of the research group.”
“I think it’s possible if you just make it right.She doesn’t have the nature of perjury.Wouldn’t you be embarrassed when you think of your memories?”
While Nade and Eruki were plotting, Shirone pointed to Siena and shouted,
“Hey! Over there!”
Siena, who was hovering in the same place, twisted her steps.Like a spinning top that lost its rotational power, it was about to collapse soon.
“Catch!”
It would be a disaster if I fell in front of people.Shirone supported her on her back, and Nade and Eruki grabbed her arms from both sides.
“Sir, get a hold of yourself.We can enter the school only when the teacher is fine.”
“Well, I’m dizzy.”
Siena staggered with a fork.I emptied a bottle of cognac in an hour and circled it dozens of times, would I be sober?It wasn’t a drink, it was a punishment.
“Hey, hey! I can’t do this.Shirone, you should carry him on your back.”
“What? Why me?”
“But you’re the strongest of us all.”
Shirone sighed.Three 18-year-old boys gathered, but they couldn’t sleep and eat because they were concentrating on magic training, so their physical strength was lower than their peers.
Perhaps because Shirone had climbed mountains and trees since childhood, he was more energetic than his friends.
“I can’t do it,”I’ll have you on my back, sir to carry me on your back.”
“Don’t make it so obvious that you don’t like it.Do you think there are many chances to piggyback a teacher?I’m rather jealous.”
Nade’s expression was nothing to envy.Instead, he grinned disgustingly with a relieved look.
“Well, if you can’t speak,”
Shirone, carrying Shirona on his back, moved on.Outside the aristocracy, the number of people decreased noticeably.Leisure activities were just a luxury for ordinary people who earned and ate from day to day.
“But Siena is surprisingly small.It’s really small on my back.I usually thought I was about the same height as myself.”
“It’s a psychological problem, isn’t it?Teachers always look big, don’t they?
“Is that so? But it’s surprisingly heavy.It’s getting harder.”
Eruki nodded and laughed.
“Hehe. He’s a human being, isn’t he?”All women are made up of bones, muscles and flesh.You didn’t think it was as light as a feather, did you?”
I didn’t think about it, but I expected it to be vaguely light.However, it could not be found that he had never even held a woman’s hand, let alone carried her.
“No! I know that much.But this is really hard.I don’t think I can make it to school.”
“If you can’t go, we can’t go either.Just hang in there.”
“Can’t we use magic?”You can fly it with air magic.”
“But I’m a teacher, but that’s a little…….”
When I remembered it, I thought it would look strange.At last, Shirone, who had been acting as a palanquin, grumbled again at the idea of unfairness.
“There are three men, and one woman can’t hold it. What’s wrong?”I’m jealous of Liane at times like this.If it were Rian, she could carry me on her back.I’d rather learn how to do it.”
Nade and Eruki remained silent.To be honest, I felt ashamed because I couldn’t carry a slender woman on my back.
But indeed, women were heavier creatures than I thought, and they, who knew nothing but books, had not the slightest force.
“What can I do? All I did was breathe.I’m confident in using my brain.”
Eruki flicked his finger.
“Well, let’s use our brains,”Learn the schema right now.What do you think, Shirone?Can you do it?”
“Does that make sense?”What should I do with the schema all of a sudden?”
“You can try,”In my case, I did the Spirit Zone at once.You didn’t do it, did you?”
said Nade.
“No, I did it at once, too.I got the hang of it, and it worked right away.”Shirone, how about you?”
Shirone, who was groaning under the weight of Shirona, looked up.
“Huh? Oh, I did it at once.In fact, I didn’t even know it was a Spirit Zone at the time.”
Can I enter the Spirit Zone without knowing it’s the Spirit Zone?I thought that was just like Shirone, so I giggled.
“It’s unusual, though,”Anyway, that’s why I want you to try it right away.Isn’t the basic principle the same?”
It turned out that Eruki’s words were plausible.Of course, there is aptitude, but challenging was not a loss.
“Should I? Should I really give it a try?”In fact, my arm is so stiff that I’m about to die.”

Chapter - 61 - Siena Under the Moonlight (4) 5.txt
===============================
[61] Under the moonlight, Siena (4)
Nade instigated it.
“Try it, try it said.First of all, you have to project the image of your body from a state of immobility.And then….”
“I know what it is, too,”Wait a minute.Let me concentrate.”
Shirone closed his eyes when his friends closed their mouths.a state of selflessness just before entering the Spirit Zone.From there, it reflects the image of the body and awakens the senses of the whole body with insight!
“Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”Oh, no, I can’t.It’s getting harder.”
said Eruki, holding back his laughter.
“You fool, do you really think you can do it?”Being specialized in the Spirit Zone means that you are completely incapable of schemas.”
“Hahaha!”
Nade burst into laughter, and Shirone looked back at them with his axe-eyed eyes.
“I won’t do it!”Change!”
Eventually, the three of them took turns carrying her on their backs.
Nade, however, spread out half the distance Shirone had walked, and Yiruki could not move ten steps at all.
Shirone, who carried Siena again with his shaky arm, was absurd.
“Hey, don’t we look so pathetic?”
“It’s not polite of you to say out loud what you need to think, Shirone.”
After Nade’s words, the three of them shut up.But that didn’t mean he was in a sense of shame.I was just too tired to talk.
By the time I got to school, Shirone suddenly spoke to me.
“There you are…Let’s not do that.”
“What do you mean? Which one?”
“Negotiating with Siena about what happened today.”
“Well,”
It was true that Nade was also guilty of conscience.However, the existence of the research group was at stake, nothing else was at stake.
“But there’s no good way,”Have you come up with a plan to save the research group?”
“No, but I think it should be separate from that.To be honest, today……it must have been a very sad day for Ms. Siena.I don’t know exactly, but that’s how I feel.”
It was a fact that everyone felt.I said goodbye to the person I had kept in mind since I was a child.Siena was a strong person just by drinking a drink.
“But isn’t it strange to be so sentimental?”What’s the reason we live?You’re a dead body except when you use your head.At times like this, you have to be cool-headed.There is no way to save the research group right away, so is there any need to overdo it?”
Eruki’s words were also convincing.If you make a wrong decision because you are biased toward emotion, the future that will unfold is a series of hardships.
Nade’s heart sank quietly, too.
“Well, to be honest, Ms. Siena is the type that is hard to deal with.There’s no weakness.How could we have thought of this?It is true that it is a golden opportunity.”
Eruki agreed.
“He has a rough personality, he’s meticulous in planning, and he’s meticulous in managing students.Especially you’ve you heard of it.You even talked about going out with Shirone to stop overflowing.What can we do against an opponent who is so close?”
“These things…!”
Siena, listening with her eyes closed, choked up.I was depressed and tired, so I tried to carry him on my back quietly, but I couldn’t listen to him.
“But now I know,”
said Shirone.
“Why did the teacher choose to be a teacher, and why he was so obsessed with overflow?Siena doesn’t want us to walk the same path as her.”
“Well, but…….”
“No matter what you do, it’s important that you truly care for us.But what about us?You’re trying to attack the teacher’s painful past with your weakness.I don’t think the senior members of the research group want to see their juniors so broken.”
This time, Eruki could not refute it.The wizard always seeks efficiency, but if he is too focused on efficiency, he misses something really important.
“…you always hit the nail on the head at times like this.”
said Nade, who had made his decision.
“Well, let’s keep the teacher’s business secret today.What do you think, Rudy?”
“I have no complaints if I can’t relate to the work of the research group.To be honest, I think Mr. Siena is the best in education.”
“Well, we’re the bad guys.There are few teachers who take care of their students as well as Mr. Siena.Besides, you’ve really cut me some slack compared to what we’ve done.”
said Eruki.
“I’ll let you go this time.”It’s a research group. If the three of us put our heads together, we can find a solution, right?”
said Shirone.
“Then that’s how you do it, isn’t it?Even if you are to be disciplined tomorrow, what happened today will be taken to the grave.Don’t ever say it!”
“Good! Sold!”
When I got out of the hope torture, I felt better.Shirone’s party walked with a lighter mind than before.No one knew that Siena, who was on Shirone’s back, had opened her eyes for some time.
I saw the main gate of the magic school.Shirone, half exhausted, found a guard standing with a torch and stopped.It was not midnight yet, so the overtime team was not leaving work.
“What should I do? If I go back to this state, I don’t know what kind of rumors there will be.”Besides, we’re going out without permission, aren’
“I can’t do it,”Let’s use magic from here on out.I’ll float Ms. Siena, and you’ll hold him.”
“Wait a minute. Put the teacher down for now.Eruki, help me.”
As I bent my knees, the weight on my back suddenly disappeared.Shiona stood upright as Shiona looked back in astonishment.His drunken appearance disappeared, and his eyes were as clear as starlight.
“Sir, sir?”
Shirone, feeling dejected, sank to the ground.If you were able to walk, what would become of yourself that you had worked so hard to carry?
“Are you sure you’re all right, sir?”
“Well, did you really think I’d get drunk.
Shirone let out a heavy breath and wept.
“But why have you ever……?”
“If you’ve eaten an expensive meal, you’ll have to pay for it.You didn’t want to suffer this much?Anyway, come with me.If you want to go in beautifully.”
Shirone’s party followed Shirona as if possessed.The guard who recognized her greeted her with sleepy eyes.
“Oh, good night, Siena,”
“Yes. Thank you very much.”
“But… Did you go out with the students?”
“Yes. I brought him out on a field trip.”
“Oh, I see,”I’m glad you’Have a comfortable night.”
Although the school regulations prohibit students from entering at night, there was no doubt that Siena, who has a high reputation on campus, said it.
Shirone’s party, frightened, quickly walked past the school gate.I was nervous that the guard might call me from behind.When she reached Central Park safely, she turned around and stared at them.
“Oops!”
Shirone’s party finally felt it.that he had returned to the Alpeas School of Witchcraft.
“I’ll let what happened today go.”
When something completely different came out, Shirone’s party glanced at Shirona with astonishment.
“I’ll give you another month from today.That’s the best bargaining chip I can offer.”
Shirone’s party realized what they were talking about.Initializing the grace period meant trying to win a real game.
“Find a way to convince the school in a month.Whether you hold a presentation or bring a ghost, it’s up to you.If you’re really proud of the research group, fight the school and get what you want.That’s my view of education and the way I love my students.”
Shirone’s party was choked up.I couldn’t believe that Siena, not anyone else, had told me this.
“Yes! Look forward to it!”I’m sure you’ll surprise the school!”
“That’s right! It’s not our style to get caught up!”Let’s really think about it and try it this time!”
Siena smiled bitterly as she looked at her students who had regained their confidence.It is true that anxiety is relieved first when their motivation is high, but on the other hand, I was looking forward to what great work they could do.
“Hoo-hoo. Try your best.”I’ve had enough of my students.”
Invisibility (1)
Shirone, who visited the research group later than usual, looked at Nade and Eruki lying on the sofa and raised their hands helplessly.
“Good-bye,”
“Did you sleep well last night?”
“I don’t know. I don’t know if I slept.What about you?”
“Same, what are we going to do now?”We had a meeting all night yesterday, and we didn’t get any good ideas.”
said Shirone, sitting on the sofa.
“I must make a decision today.Let’s take measures.”
“So how?Supernatural psychic science is an invisible phenomenon.But humans don’t believe in invisible things.”
The same story was repeated last night.Tired of even speaking, they stared blankly at only one place.I felt empty in my head and blank.How long had it been, Shirone’s eyes returned to focus.
“Why don’t you change your mind?”
Nade and Eruki sprang to their feet.I don’t know what words will come out, but it was definitely different from the patterns that have appeared so far.
“How?”
“So that’s the dilemma we’re facing.There is no way to show the invisible.”
“Yes, that’s a big problem.”
“So, I mean, if it’s invisible, you don’t have to show it.Should I say that I’ve been clinging to the impossible?I think it would be better to try not to show it.”
Saying that it doesn’t matter if you don’t show it was also in line with saying that there was no need for a presentation.But my friends were not disappointed.Rather, I was lost in thought, perhaps because I realized something.
“What you can’t verify means you don’t have to verify it.”
“That’s it,”The reason why I joined the research group is not because you showed me something.Then wouldn’t it be the same for everyone else?”
A smile crept around Eruki’s mouth.
“Why didn’t I think of that?”That’s right. We didn’t have to verify it from the beginning.We didn’t have to show them what we didn’t know.On the contrary…….”
“You make them believe in invisible things, don’t you?”
Nade was convinced that this was the answer he was looking for.Immediately he left his seat and rolled over, hugging Shirone.
“Shirone! Come here!”You saved our research group!You may take my first kiss!”
“Go away!”
While Shirone and Nade were making a great deal of money on the sofa, he was lost in thought.The real difficulty was from now on.
“Then what shall we do?”Shirone’s words are the solution, but you have to have the character of a presentation anyway.In the end, we need tangible results.”
Nade returned to his seat.Shirone swept his messy hair, too.It wasn’t the time to play around.
“Let’s think about it.What are you going to show me?”
The three of them put their heads together.Once the strands were caught, there were endless ways to come up with them.The point was something that would make you believe in the invisible.
“Wouldn’t it be better to be auditory?”It’s easy to design.”
“Effective, though.But it doesn’t work.We must also consider whether the school will accept it.”
“Then let’s go with the visual.If you can, your hearing ability. Put everything you can into it.”
“Then what do you visualize?”Supernatural or psychic?
“The supernatural is not popular.I think a ghost would be good.”
Nade raised his hand.
“I vote for the spirit, too.There must be a soul, a ghost, a ghost, or a phenomenon, which of these?”
said Shirone.
“Don’t you think ghosts are better?”It’s intense.”
“But wouldn’t it be childish?”
Nade looked skeptical.But Yiruki saw that Shirone was right.
“I think ghosts are better.The key is to penetrate people’s thoughts strongly.”
“Well, it’s childish no matter how many times I think about it.”
said Shirone.
“The first thing to think about is the effect.The other thing is a secondary problem.I don’t think you need to give up.”

“Have you thought of anything?”
“Let’s set up a psychological trap.For example, in this way.”
Shirone brought his friends together and explained the operation.Nade and Eruki were silent when they heard the story.added Shirone, who had lost a little confidence.
“It’s not necessarily this way, but if you do it, won’t the odds go up?”For example, if you want to use a keyword…….”
Eruki shook his head.
“No, Shirone, I think it’s all right.It’s not enough, it’s definitely going to be a successfully.This is quite mysterious.This way we can use the presentation as a double track.”
When the overall picture was drawn, Shirone’s party began to work out detailed strategies.
“That’s the rest of the question.How can I make a ghost?
The technical part was Nade’s major.When he got up from the sofa and tried the lightening shadow, another nade made of an electrical afterimage appeared.
“This way, you can create a real ghost shape by demonstrating a lightening shadow.But no one would be fooled by this much.For now, I can’t move.”
“Then I’ll think about it from there.What should I do to make the ghost’s shape move?”
“This is what comes to my mind right away.For example, if you want to get the Lightning Shadow to work, you can use magic at a tremendous speed.”
Nade moved on with a series of lightening shadows.Although disconnected, the afterimage seemed to be walking.
“Well, you can use an optical illusion to make it look real, right?”
“Yes, but magic alone has its limits.Moreover, I can’t increase the number of people at my level.”
asked Shirone.
“How about using a mechanical device?”
“It’s not as easy as it sounds.Even if you’re making a device, there’s a lot to consider.The biggest problem is that people don’t fall for just moving.If you really want to look like a ghost, you have to be responsive to external stimuli.”
For Nade, who has built hologram devices, it is not a problem to implement ghost visions.But if you don’t respond to people’s behavior, you’ll soon notice that it’s fake.
said Eruki, who was struggling with something.
“People’s reactions……how about predicting in advance?”
“You’re predicting the reaction?”
“It’s about introducing the theory of complexity.They analyze and program all the public behavior patterns.It’s as if you’re getting feedback, but it’s a huge amount of information.We need a medium and a control device to communicate information.”
“Hmm. It’s information.There is indeed a limit to my electricity.Then… Ah!”
Nade looked back at Shirone.
“Photon output! There was a photon output from Shirone!”
“Aha. With photon output…….”
Shirone thought there was a possibility.Although it is a magic trick learned to take a targeting test, I heard that in the cutting edge of the magic society, research on transmitting information through photon output is in full swing.
“Now you’re in order.Nade makes a hologram device.I’m going to make a program to fit in the device.It’s the photon output of Shirone that sends my program to the device.You’ll probably need a lot of power. Can you do it?”
“I must do it,”It’s an opportunity that I got.”
It was a ray of light in the dark.Nade was thrilled just to have hope for what he thought was impossible.
“I can do it.I can keep the research group.Of course, on the assumption that there will be no accident.”
“If you succeed, the school will be overturned, right?
“I don’t think so,”It’s going to be a mess.I’ll try to hang it here.Besides, I think it’s going to be a lot of fun.Hahaha. I’m already looking forward to the teachers’
Shirone’s party looked back at each other and smiled meaningfully.At the risk of the existence of the supernatural psychological science research group, an unprecedented event in the history of the magic school was about to break out.
* * *
Shirone devoted his time to enhancing the power of photon output.The key was to increase the strength of the output while increasing the retention time.Photons without mass cannot be used as attack magic because they cannot apply physical force, but this time, such characteristics have become an advantage.This is because you can go into any warehouse in Eastas and train.
Shirone increased concentration and started photon output with his two hands out.A ray of light spread round the wall.First of all, it was time.If I couldn’t withstand it for 10 minutes in this state, it was only possible to increase the output.
Shooting photon output for 10 minutes is beyond the level of the class five, but Nade’s hologram device and Eruki’s complex system equation were the same challenge anyway.
“I have to do it,”I’ll…
Shirone gritted his teeth and endured.After three minutes, I lost consciousness.At the time of the speed gun test, it only lasted a minute with a single photon output.Compared to that, it was a remarkable growth, but it still fell short of the target.
“Gasp! Gasp!”
With all my strength, I held out for 3 minutes and 20 seconds, and I had to extend this time to 10 minutes in the next 15 days.After measuring the record, I always took 20 minutes off.It was a training that could put your life at risk if you neglect your rest.
Sitting down, Shirone paid attention to the noise from the next room.Nade seemed to have entered the welding process.I decided to take a break to look at the situation there.When I opened the door of the next room, Nade was buried in all kinds of parts.
“Hey, are you here?”How long is the output time?”
“Well, I’ve increased it by twenty seconds.What about you?”
“As you can see, I’m still working on the engine.”
“Can you make it on time?”
“Don’t worry, I’ll have to guess.Originally, prototypes take time.It’s hard to correct errors in the production process.That’s why I’m taking the time to be meticulously.
“I see. By the way, what happened to what Eruki said?”
“Oh, that one? I got it yesterday.This one.”
Nade threw a finger-thick rope at Shirone’s feet.The outer shell was made of rubber, and a quartz-like transparent membrane penetrated the interior.It was a special request from Eruki to his father, who was the head of the mine.
Since 300 holographic devices were scheduled to be installed at the elementary elements of the school, it was impossible for Shirone to test photon output on all devices alone.
At first Nade remembered the mirror.It was a method of transmitting the photon output to the mechanical device using the total reflection property of light when the syrone initiates the photon output.However, there were too many sections where light had to bend to realize it as a reality.
Nade wondered what it would be like if there were much more mirrors.It has been concluded that creating a tunnel through which light passes by attaching a mirror to a small hose can have the effect of bending light like differentiating a straight line.
Nade proudly announced the fact.He added that if he could make it, he would sit on a pile of money from that day on.
But Eruki broke the ice.My father’s letter, which arrives every month, contains various issues of magic society, because the same thing that Nade said was already introduced in his letter a few months ago.The name was “optical fiber.”
I couldn’t describe Nade’s disappointment.Even the ivory tower, which runs on the cutting edge of magic, was a field that had just been developed, so even Eruki felt sorry for it.
But when he received the goods and analyzed them, Nade shook his head.Engineering technologies that were so delicate that they could never be made at their current level were accumulated.
“But you had the same idea as the ivory tower,”Nade is really something, too.’
Shirone took the fiber-optic and examined it closely.I couldn’t tell what was great by looking at it.
“But I managed to save it.”
After the welding, Nade stood up rubbing his red eyes.
“Even the ivory tower is in its early stages, so you can’t expect its performance.Let’s give a demonstration first.There’s something I’ve made a tester for.”
Nade handed over the modified fiber to Shirone.Unlike what was shown earlier, there was a transparent bead at the end.
“What should I do with this?”
“Just grab it and start the photon output.I’ll calculate the efficiency, so try it now.Instead, you have to pour it all out.It’s important to measure the maximum.”
Shirone grabbed the crystal ball and started the photon output.The break time was over anyway, so there was nothing rough.A light source was formed in his hand, and the crystal ball shone palely.The needle began to shake in Nade’s device connected to the optical fiber.Nade, who had been watching the instrument panel until three minutes past the output limit, said in a sullen voice.
“Oh, you’re right, Eruki is right.This is an early development.Well, should I thank you for this?”
“Is it that bad?”
“It’s only 18 percent efficient.I mean, only 18 percent of the light you send will reach your destination.”
“18 percent….”
The moment he heard it, Shirone’s heart sank.In other words, if the transmission efficiency is 18 percent at a time when it is far from maintaining the photon output for 10 minutes, the output must be increased five times as high as it is now to be only 100 percent.
“Shirone, can you do it?”If you don’t increase the output, you’ll never succeed.The magical high-power energy cannot be realized even by machines.”
Shirone nodded as if he were in a ditch.
“I’ll give it a try. Practice and I’ll figure it out.”
“You can really do it, right?
“Yes, don’t worry.I’ll do something about it.Then I’ll go back to practice.”
“Really? You’re really going to do it for me.
cried Shirone, turning his head as he left the door.
“I told you!”
* * *
Shirone stretched out over the warehouse, gasping for breathless.The aftermath of the photon output for half a day went beyond the mind to the body.
“Whoo! Whoo!”
The last time photon output is 3 minutes and 20 seconds.There was no difference from the record I measured in the morning.However, it was a record that was reached while his mental strength was exhausted, so it was as good as having results.Considering that the record fell to 2 minutes and 34 seconds an hour ago, it was effective to rush at the last minute and 34 seconds.
“But that’s not enough.How can I achieve 10 minutes like this?
It may have been impossible from the beginning.In that photon output is injection-type, mental power consumption is much faster than single-acting active magic.It was only possible in the professional world to maintain such magic for 10 minutes.
“Oh, I don’t know.I’ll try again tomorrow when I’m fine.”
Nade opened the warehouse door and came in.
“Shirone, are you done?”
“Well, I can’t do it today.I need to get some rest for now.”
“I’ve only seen Spark, and I’m so tired.It’s past midnight.Let’s ask Yiruki to come back.”
Has it already become like that?When calculated, it was only photon output for more than seven hours.It was a life-threatening level of training.If the school found out about this, it would surely impose a ban on magic training.
Shirone struggled to get up.Nade’s appearance was also not a word.His eyes were hollow and his face was red from long exposure to electric light.
When I returned to the research group, Eruki spread out the bird’s-eye view of the school and was quickly playing with a pen.Considering the variables that will occur on the day of the operation, the behavioral pattern was interpreted as an equation.
Nade looked anxiously at the figure.Shironena herself, and Eruki, too, seemed to have not moved since she had her hips attached.
“What do you say, Lucky?”Can you calculate it well?”
said Eruki, keeping his eyes on the notebook.
“Don’t worry, I’ll make it in time.”
Nade was heartbroken that his excessive greed seemed to hurt his friends’ bodies.
“Was it too much to ask?”To be honest, calculating all the behavior patterns of the whole school is…….”
“I can do it,”I can do it.Don’t talk to me.I’m busy right now.”
At the end of the sentence, Yuki shut up.The formulas were writing frighteningly fast on the notebook.

insanity and ecstasy.
Shirone shuddered.Everyone had forgotten to sleep for days and was absorbed in their work.Calculating it, it seemed that the average daily sleep time was only about 1 hour and 40 minutes.
Even when Shirone was studying hard, he wasn’t working as hard as this.But strangely enough, I didn’t feel more tired than before.I felt as if the pain had been paralyzed.
“You’ve been playing around like that all the time, but you’re scaring them when it’s time to do it.”’
Shirone felt an unprecedented desire for achievement as he literally devoted himself to his field so much that even sleeping time was a waste.
“Nade, are you tired now?”
“No, not at all.Are you tired?I don’t know the truth.I feel like my head is open.”
“Me, too. I’m working on it, so let’s start with the script.I have to make a phrase for the poster.It takes time to actually do these little things.”
“Oh, is that so?”Let’s put up a poster tomorrow.”
“Are you going to be okay? I’m not even at the stage of predicting the workload.”
“We must keep it under control,”You’d better make a public announcement as soon as possible.I don’t want to make it obvious that I’m in a hurry.It’s a psychological game. Shouldn’t we consider this?”
“I see. Then I’ll make a poster phrase, and you think about the design.”
The two laid paper on the table and began to make posters.It was late at night, but their minds were still bright.
The next day.
At the end of lunch time, a poster was posted on the bulletin board.It was a presentation announcement by the Psychological Science Research Council.Most of the students were puzzled.Even the name was unfamiliar because they did not engage in official activities as a dark research group.The poster, in particular, was so ignorant that it made me laugh in vainly.The scene of the magic school was distorted to create a bleak landscape, as if looking at a circus poster.
A surprise presentation from the Psychological Research Society of Supernatural!
Shocking revelation! If you want to know who your soul is, gather at the 7th Lecture Hall.
“Psychological science? What’s that?Are you talking about ghosts?”
“There was a research group like this.I guess I really have nothing to do.Who is it?What about the kids who went into this silly research group?”
“Oh, boys, look at this.”
The girl pointed at the bottom of the poster.The eyes of the students who discovered the names of the researchers were wide open.
“It’s Shirone’s senior, isn’t it?”What’s going on here?Is there a person with the same name?”
“How could that be?”It’s really Shirone.There are also Mercodine Eruki and Nade next to me.”
“But all three of you?”Was it made for the performance evaluation?It’s too much to do.Why are you doing this kind of research?”
“When is the presentation?”Shall we attend, too.
“I’d like to go,”I’m getting interested in Shirone’s song.Did you really find out who the ghost is?”
“You’ll find out when you see it.”Laughing! Anyway, it sounds fun.”
The students turned away in a casual way.It was like going to a theater performance, not an academic conference.On the other hand, those who work in the dark, such as the supernatural psychological science research group, could not hide their wonder.They whispered as they gathered out of the public eye.
“What’s going on?”What do you mean a presentation at “Beginner’s Psychological Society?”
“It seems that the intelligence was at odds with Siena.You’ve decided to play a game.But can you do anything?It’s not what it used to be.The days of glory are over.”
“You can’t make it neat.Eruki is a servant, and Nade’s skill cannot be ignored.Shirone, a new member of the company, has also disbanded the Black Magisher.I don’t think it’s going to end like this.”
“Kkkkkkkk. You’re the only one in the lower grades.Anyway, let’s wait and see.If the Chosimnyeonghoe is gone, there will be a war.for the second master of Eastarth.”
“It won’t be easy.The Women’s Human Research Society has long been eyeing it.The Economic Research Society “Geum Hwa-ryun” is also preparing to open a black market.It’s an opportunity to take a good care of yourself.”
“Well, our puppet show is no joke.I swear on my lovely pokos.Eastarth’s “upper” is ours.”
Their eyes burned, recalling the upper part of Eastas, which is only a legend.Those who know and don’t know the Psychological Science Research Society.Everyone expected the presentation to be successful, although everyone had different circumstances.
On the other hand, the parties did not have time to care about such things.There was only one idea that filled their minds.
Why is a day only 24 hours a day?
If it had been about 200 hours a day.No, if it had only been 48 hours, I would have produced a perfect result.
However, it was not foolish enough to waste time in delusion.The three were working on the work, splitting the day as small as possible.
Nade, who succeeded in developing the prototype, held a demonstration in front of Shirone and Eruki.The hologram device was a hemispherical machine that looked like a bowl of rice was upside down, and output terminals were attached one after another on the outside.While Eruki was setting up a function on the device, Shirone waited holding a crystal ball of optical fiber.
“Shirone, try the photon output.”
“Will it be okay? It’s not perfect yet”.
“It’s the same with us.You have to demonstrate first to find something to make up for.”
“I see,”
Shirone, clutching each of the two crystal beads, launched a powerful photon output.Electricity was generated at the output terminal of the hologram device, and the shape of a translucent person appeared.Although there is a limit to the clarity that can be electrically implemented, Nade thought it was rather better.This is because the ghost that students imagine will also feel like this.
“This is a hologram,”
Ghosts were soldiers in ancient armor.His face was horribly stained and bones were exposed throughout his body.
“First of all, the frame is fine.It’s your turn, Yuruki.”
Eruki activated Nade’s controller.There are only four buttons, but dozens of patterns could be expressed because combinations were possible.Whenever the button was pressed, the soldier’s hologram showed various movements.Eruki, who was watching the soldiers walk around the warehouse, was satisfied.
“First of all, there is no problem with the function.I think we can go like this.All that’s left is Shirone.Are you sure? On the day of the presentation, the number of devices will increase tremendously.”
Shirone, who demonstrated it himself, was also worried.Power generation can be recovered as much as possible with Nade’s electricity, but the problem was information delivery.This is because my mind was quite tired even though I only operated one hologram device.
“I’ll do my best.Still, it’s hopeful that the maintenance time is increasing.So now Nade is going into mass production.Is ROOKIE’s team finished?”
“No, I still have a lot to make up for.If you consider psychological changes, it will take a year to analyze them.We consider the probability of approximately 5% or more as a practical variable.But you’ll still be on time.”
“First of all, I’ve got a prototype, so I’m going to make a winning move from today.I don’t have time to rehearse.Let’s stick to our roles for the rest of our time.”
That’s what he said, but everyone knew that Shirone was the most burdensome person.Even if a few devices fail or the function of Eruki is slightly wrong, the operation will proceed anyway.However, if the output weakens, students will not even be able to try the operation and even laugh at it.
“Limit ten minutes.If you don’t get there, there’s only one presentation.”
Returning to the warehouse, Shirone looked back on the training he had done so far.Mental reinforcement takes place in the form of a rebound.It rarely became increasingly strong.a zigzag pattern of falling and rising.In addition, the larger the fall, the greater the increase.
“The more we push our minds to the limit, the greater the extent of our reinforcement.”
It was the conclusion that Shirone had come to.If you borrow this method from physical training, you will not be able to withstand it for a month and your body will break, but your mind has the elasticity to withstand high levels of stress.In particular, there was no better way to train Shirone, whose strength is durability.
pushing oneself to the brink of destruction of consciousness
It may be accompanied by pain, but this was the only solution to overcome the current difficulties.
`More, more, more, more!’’
The size of the light source reflected on the wall was getting bigger.
* * *
It was the last day I promised my friends.
Time was drawing near midnight.The warehouse where Shirone was training was as bright as day with the light of photon output light.Shirone, who shot the photon with both hands, closed his eyes tightly and bit his lips.His body gradually twisted and his legs struggled with pain.My consciousness seemed to melt away.It was something that might drive me crazy at this rate.
“Ahhhhaha.
Shirone even scooped up a handful of mental strength.The next moment the light disappeared like a faucet.I heard the sound of kneeling in the dark warehouse.
“Gasp! Gasp!”
Shirone checked the time with his knee when he crawled down the clock’s button.
10 minutes and 32 seconds.
“Well, hahaha…….”
It was an incredible result that made me laugh.
The photon output was maintained for more than 10 minutes.It was thanks to thousands of mental rebounds in a short period of a month.Spirit zones have become dramatically stronger, and their main specialty magic power has also been raised to a level above Class Five.
As the iron door opened, Nade, who had not been seen for several days, came in.He had to walk around the school in a transparent cloak, but his complexion was much worse than before.
“Shirone, the training is over.It’s time for a rehearsal.”
Knowing that Shirone’s target was too high, Nade deliberately didn’t ask for results.Shirone, who was sweating, threw the cogwheel timewatch.Nade’s eyes opened wide when he accepted it.10 minutes and 32 seconds.It was a startling shame.
“Did you… really do it?”
said Shirone, with his thumb raised, with a smile.
“Goal accomplished. Let’s go for it.”
* * *
Alpeas School of Witchcraft and Wizardry 7th Lecture.
The presentation was held at 5 p.m., but an hour ago, people were crowded in front of the lecture hall with people.Rumors spread and spread, and most of the students gathered to attend the presentation of the supernatural psychological science conference.
“Wow! There are so many people.I’ve never heard of the name of a research group before.As expected, stars are different.
I was amazed to see the line of Serie A.She had been promoted to a graduate school after Shirone’s Speed Gun test, so she did not know much about the research group.
Amy looked surprised, too.It was great that Class Five, a research group with only three members, could attract so many people.
“You should have caused a lot of trouble.Anyway, the box office was a success.”
“I didn’t expect Shirone to get along with Eruki.I’m afraid I can’t live or die now.”
As the two lined up, the high-level students stirred up.The seniors of the senior year came to see me.Although it was a Class Three badge on his collar, his eyes were naturally in awe of the report.
“Wow, it’s Amy.Is this kind of sloppy presentation something for seniors to attend?”
“You idiot. Shirone’s lover is Amy.He was always with me when I was in high school.”
“But…… Then what are the seniors over there.
The students’ eyes were focused on one place.Amy and Cherie also looked back and looked surprised.
“Oh? Amy, look over there.”Here comes Cayden, isn’t he?
Cayden, who was in the Class Two, had his hand in his pocket.Around him is Richard the Alchemist.Electric Monster Likan.There were many talented people from Class Two, a holy name for high-end class children such as Sona’s Hershi.

[64] Invisible (4)
However, even the seniors of Class Two were only supporting actors compared to the recognition of men who had just entered the line.
A handsome man dressed in ready-made clothes and with his hair neatly turned over was looking up at the sky leisurely.
It was Ardino Fermi of Class One.
When Class One, the peak of the magic school, appeared, the atmosphere became solemn.Seriel also realized the seriousness of the situation and whispered.
“Even so, isn’t it strange that you came all the way to Fermi because you didn’t have enough class?”
“I didn’t come here for Shirone’s sake.Do you know what they have in common?”
“Well, I don’t know. It’s hard to get to know him”.
“That’s it,”It’s probably a research group that works in the dark.It’s like a black magisher.Of course, they’re on a different level.”
“Oh, yes, I’ve heard that the Shirone research group is quite notorious, too.But Fermi is very surprising.I don’t know about the others, but he’s popular, right?They’re so kind.”
“That’s why I feel even worse.I always feel like I’m up to something.Let’s ignore it anyway.I don’t think they’re seniors or anything.”
All 30 graduates were competitors.Every year, 10 graduates leave school and are given classes according to their grades in the graduation exam.Therefore, the current students of Class One were not in the top 10 in last year’s graduation exam.
The reason why it cannot be regarded as simply a loser is because it is at the top of the pyramid.In any competition, the higher the rank, the smaller the gap in skills.There is little difference in superiority or inferiority in class one.The condition of the day, the presence or absence of a strategy, concentration and choice will determine graduation and elimination.
None of the students ignored Fermi.Rather, I was surprised that the person who is currently at the forefront of the magic school visited the presentation of Class Five.
Fermi’s appearance spread quickly through word of mouth, and by the time the presentation was approaching, there was a series of lines that would remain full.
At last the entrance was opened, and the students rushed in.The front row was the seats of teachers, and the students filled the seats in the order they came in.Amy, who had been waiting for so long, sat side by side with Seriel near the stage.
“What are you going to show us?”
No matter how much I thought about it, the box office hit was strange.It was extremely rare to come to Class One at the presentation of a high-end class.It’s not just a presentation.Amy waited for Shirone to come out in a tense atmosphere.The fire in the hall went out.
* * *
A ray of light came down in the darkroom.The spotlight swept through the stage and illuminated the boy standing in the center.
“Good morning, gentlemen,”Thank you for coming to the presentation of the Psychic Science Research Council.My name is Nade, and I’m the president of the research group.Today, we would like to introduce the human soul.Now, let’s begin the presentation.”
A round of applause poured of applause.About three seconds after the spotlight was turned off, the stage brightened like dawn, and a bleak mountain scene was revealed behind the stage.
“The children have prepared a lot.”
said Alpeas, with a satisfied look.In general, presentations are evaluated by teachers, but this time Alpeas was also specially visited to examine Shirone’s achievement.
On the other hand, Siena has not yet been impressed.It is a great idea to replace the stage device with an electric tent rather than an artifact, but no matter how cool the technology is, it was a failure for the research presentation.
Nade, who moved to the end of the stage, narrated.
“Five or twenty years ago.Before the establishment of the Alpeas School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, it was a small slash-and-burner village.It was a time when people who lost their country in the conquest war wandered.Today, we are going to tell you the story of a woman who escaped the war and entered the town of Hwajeonmin.”
When the dark field passed and the light came on, Eruki, dressed as a soldier, limped onto the stage.
“Oh, oh, oh! I’m hungry…”…I’m hungry… “
Laughter burst out from all over the auditorium.
“Haha! What’s that?”
“Well, Lany,”What kind of play is this?”
Nade supplemented the shortcomings through narration whenever Eruki’s lines were absent.
This is the gist of it.
It was the same with the soldiers who fled in the conquest war.
But they were not alive.
They were demons who wandered around the world deprived of their bodies by evil spirits and came into the Hwajeonmin village after smelling the raw flesh.
As Eruki disappeared behind the stage after showing off the eccentricity of the monkfish, Nade, dressed up as the male protagonist, appeared.
“Ah, my love, Ollia!”Why should a noble lineage like yours suffer in this mountain?If I could, I’d like to sell my soul to regain the glory that was brilliant, but I’m sorry I can’t.”
His vocalization and acting were quite good.However, the children who came because they thought it was a presentation were really confused when they entered the play.Moreover, when Shirone, dressed as a woman, rushed out to the stage from the other side of Nade, she was stunned.
“Noah! Noah!”
(Laughs)
The students burst into laughter, regardless of who they were.Shirone, with her waist-length blond hair, was really like a woman.He tightened his waist to emphasize the line, and even his chest showed what he had put in his clothes.
“Well, Amy,”
The absurd Seriel looked back at Amy.As expected, he was watching the play with a rotten smile.
Since Nade, a commentator, participated as an actor, the two communicated the situation through dialogue.
It was just a plot.
Noah and Olia promised the future under the control of the noble family, but the war caused the family to be scattered and eventually entered Hwajeon Minchon to continue their love.
“I missed you, Olya,”My love. My everything.I love you.”
“I love you, Noah,”
Shirone and Nade looked at each other and hugged each other.The next situation could be predicted by anyone.
The highlight of the play is the kiss scene of a lover.
Of the many audiences, the most excited person was by far Seriel.
“Are you really going to do it?”Huh? Really? What should I do?”
Amy swallowed her saliva, feeling unprecedented tension.I didn’t think men would really kiss each other, but if it was a play, it was a mystery.
As the tension of the audience increased, Shirone closed his eyes and Nade slowly extended his face.
“Oh my god!”
From behind Nade, Eruki suddenly appeared and bit his neck.When the sound system screamed loudly, the surprised audience screamed.
No one expected Eruki to appear.This is because it is impossible to make such a production with only stage equipment.Shirone wrote the script for these points.He thought he could surprise people with his transparent cloak.As the tension increased, the audience gradually fell into the play.
After knocking down Nade, Eruki pretended to eat the flesh.The sound system mixed the sound of bone crushing, flesh chewing, screaming and screaming.
“No! Noah! Noah!”
When the soldier, who had eaten raw flesh, disappeared, Ollia held Noah in her arms and screamed.The story ran towards tragedy, and half-crazy Olina was pouring out a curse and killed herself with the dagger she had.The students remained silent in a solemn atmosphere at the sight of a man and a woman who died toward each other.
The darkness passed, and Nade, who returned as a commentator, reappeared on the stage.While everyone was waiting for his narration, Olya suddenly got up and burst into a crazy laugh.
“Hahaha! I won’t forgive you.I’ll kill them all.”
Ollina killed people at random before the audience could calm down.Then, with a tearful scream, he disappeared off the stage, and the story ended.
Nade walked up to the center and continued to explain.
“We discovered this story six months ago.Thanks to the old diary I found while tracking the history of the magic school.”
Nade took out a notebook.It was a notebook 520 years ago buried in the soil, but it was actually made in a hurry a few days ago.
“Our psychological members immediately launched an investigation.Then I realized a shocking secret that no one knew.It’s the fact that the old spirits of that time are still wandering in this school.”
Ring, ring.
The bell rang backstage.The students listened to a familiar sound.It was a bell ringing at midnight.
“Every night at midnight, hungry devils roam about.This is the surest proof of the existence of the soul.”
The children frowned.This was because even after years of attending school, I didn’t even see a suspicious person, let alone a ghost.
“I don’t think you’ve ever seen a ghost.That’s what we did.According to supernatural psychic science, the soul has a property that is visible only to the eyes of the believer.It’s because the mental frequency has to match.That’s why we decided to hold a presentation.Now that you know the history of the original soul, your frequency is set.From today onwards, when the midnight bell rings, you will be able to see ghosts wandering about the nine heavens.”
Nade winked for the last time.
“If you’re lucky,”That’s it for the presentation.”
When Nade greeted and disappeared backstage, silence enveloped the hall.There was no applause, and the atmosphere was cold.
The students shuddered with betrayal and despondency.It’s called a research presentation, but it’s a classic theatrical performance.
“What? Was it just a joke?”I thought you’d show me something great.”
“We’re foolish to expect that.Honestly, how can I prove a ghost?I was completely taken in.Well, I shouldn’t have come.”
“Well, it’s like a five-star restaurant.Shironenny and Rukini have been talking a lot, but they don’t have much substance.Hey, let’s go. I’ve wasted my time.”
The voices of the students were heard here and there.They were studying while saving time to play, so it was a waste of time flying to such a childish presentation.
As the students left one by one, Mark and Maria descended the procession and greeted Amy and Seriel.
“Hello, sir. How are you?”
“Well, it’s been a long time,”
“What did you think about this presentation?”
Mark seems to have been equally absurd.In particular, since he knew Shirone’s genius, it was even harder to accept today’s presentation.
But Amy had nothing in particular to say.There was neither an excuse nor an excuse to pack.All it seemed was to be seen, and the presentation was over.
But Seriel was still on the side of Shirone.
“I’ve prepared something, but I’m afraid it’s a setback.Or time is running out.It’s probably like that.Right, Amy?”
“Anyway, it’s true that you failed.Anyway, I should have guessed from the moment I heard that I was hanging out with strange children.Let’s go now.”
As Amy left first, Seriel pouted his lips.
“Why are you so indifferent to your lover?”
“Ha-ha! That’s Amy’s charm.Perhaps the most upset person now is Amy.”
When I heard what Mark said, I felt sorry for her.
Even after the students left the lecture hall, the teachers were still unable to leave.To be honest, I didn’t even know what to write on the evaluation paper.
“What are you going to do with this?”I’d rather not do anything.’
In particular, the shock she received was enormous.I can’t believe I’m holding such a mischievous presentation in front of the principal, not anyone else.I was so nervous about how to cover up the situation.

Siena threw down the evaluation paper and apologized to Alpeas.
“I’m sorry, Principal,”He came to see me in person.”
“Well, it was a difficult task.Isn’t supernatural psychological science supposed to be like that?Don’t worry about it.”
“I’ll be sure to warn you,”
Alpeas raised his hand as if he were okay, and walked to the doorway.But just before leaving the door, he turned around again and looked at the empty stage.The corners of his mouth hidden in his beard went up.
“If it was going to end like this, I wouldn’t have even started.”Don’t you think so? You’re sick of it.
* * *
“That’s it. The first stage is over!”
Regardless of the audience’s response, Shirone and his group rushed to the research group.From now on, it was a real game.
“You’re sure it worked, aren’t you?”
“Well, I could tell by the look in your eyes.”
As the students’ expectations were high, they were already expecting the presentation to end blandly.But Shirone hoped this would happen.This is because the less important you think, the stronger your psychological accessibility becomes.This was the gist of the psychological trap he had planned.
group hypnosis
The keyword was the sound of a bell ringing at midnight.Once you understand the content, it doesn’t matter how childish it is.Keywords imprinted in their heads will lead them to fear.
“It’s up to you now, Shirone,”All you have to do is succeed.”
“All right. I’ll meditate here for a while.”
“You must succeed!”I trust you!”
I did my best for a month.Now the baton had been handed over to the last runner, Shirone.
“I have to concentrate, so get away from me.”
Shirone, who had dissuaded Nade from rubbing his shoulder, sat down in a remote place.The remaining time is six hours.In it, I had to raise my mental condition to the top.
“One, two, three.”
Shirone proceeded with the ceremony slowly, with his head bowed.Nade and Eruki sneaked out of the room, even watching their breaths.
The success or failure of the presentation will be determined by the support of the mental power that can last more than 10 minutes of photons for more than 10 minutes.However, the rest of the work was not finished.
Eruki had to install a hologram remote control device, and Nade had to maintain the core where Shirone would pour out photon output.With everyone busy working on the work, it has already darkened and midnight.
Shirone opened his eyes in the dark darkness of no one else.Shirone’s spirit, which lasted for five hours, was comparable to a well-grounded sword.After a while, the door opened, and Nade’s quiet voice seeped in.
“It’s time to go, Shirone,”
Shirone rose from his seat as if he had nothing to do with it.Then, like a fighter going out to the Colosseum, he followed Nade’s.
* * *
The core of the hologram device was installed in a sewer that flowed under the central park.About 10 strands of optical fiber extending from a huge device went up to the ground, and from there, it went through a multi-adapter and spread to hundreds of strands.
The operation involved as many as 300 holographic devices.Shirone shook his tongue at Nade’s volume productivity, but the burden also increased.
Although it was said to have succeeded in maintaining photon output for 10 minutes, it was the first time in practice.No one knew what unexpected variables would occur.
Ten minutes before midnight, Shirone walked to a mechanical device ten times larger than the prototype.
When Nade handed over the input/output terminal with a grim look, Shirone held the crystal ball with both hands.Eruki took a timewatch and timed it.Don’t be too fast or too slow.The hologram had to be activated at the exact time the bell rang.
“Are you ready? We have to start now.”
Shirone took a deep breath and nodded.Eruki looked at the clock with his right hand raised.When it was time to go, his hand fell vigorously.At the same time, Shirone’s sequence began to rise at a tremendous speed.The power of light from both hands was incomparably stronger than before.My friends were amazed at how much photon output has been raised in a month.
“More, stronger!”
The light source has become so large that it devours Shirone.Nade rushed to the core device to check the efficiency of the transmission.Eruki asked frustratedly, as he remained stiff with surprise.
“What do you think? What’s the percentage?”
Nade, who had been silent for a long time, said in a trembling voice.
“Twenty-seven percent.
“What?”
The figure was much lower than expected.Where in the world did it go wrong?But I didn’t have time to analyze it.If I can’t do it now, it’s all over.
“The radius is too wide.It’s impossible at this rate.’
Shirone had a hunch from the beginning.This is because, as soon as the photon output was turned on, an empty sensation rushed into the mind as if pouring water into a bottomless pot.
The information transmission efficiency of optical fibers was 18%, and the transmission power was greatly weakened by parallel connection in that state.
Shirone printed out photons for several minutes.However, no matter how hard I tried, the output efficiency did not go up further from 17%.
Eruki realized that there was no need to try again.Even if I operated the device in this state, most of the holograms would have been broken like fragments.
Five minutes later, Nade smiled.Although he failed, Shirone was proud to have reached an impossible goal with great effort.It was all because of my own poor design.
“Shirone, that’s enough.We did well enough.Let’s stop here.”
Shirone did not answer.To be honest, I was dying of anger.It was a project that Nade, Eruki, and the research group all worked together to sell out.
But I can’t believe this is the end.I haven’t accomplished anything yet, but I have to admit defeat with tears in my eyes.
“How did you get here?”
Shirone closed his eyes with a strong heart.I haven’t put everything into it yet.Gradually the light source in his hand swelled and began to cover Shirone’s whole body.
“Come on, don’t tell me.
Nade realized what Shirone was thinking.
mental function
He entered the forbidden realm again, where he could lose everything.
“Shirone! Stop!Don’t do it!”
Nade and Eruki shook Shirone’s body.However, Shirone’s spirit, which was driven toward Nirvana, was not even damaged by a considerable disturbance.
Shirone’s light source had already devoured itself and extended to the outside.cried Nade, with tears in his eyes, thinking that something terrible would happen if we left it as it was.
“Shirone! Please stop!I can’t lose you!You can give up the research group!Please stop!”
Nade’s voice awoke Shirone’Shirone’s eyes.Shirone’s eyes, nose, and mouth, glimmering with a frightening gaze, were leaking out.
“Yes, Nade…….”
“Yes, sir!Let’s stop! Let’s stop here!”
The corners of Shirone’s mouth rose gently.
“Now… I’m not afraid.”
The moment Shirone closed his eyes again, a huge light filled the tunnel.His mental strength began to spread indefinitely.
I can’t stop you now.
Nade and Eruki stepped back with a stunned look on their faces.I only prayed earnestly that Shirone could come back again.
In the realm of infinity, Shirone felt a longing sensation.
The feeling that everything that makes you is meaningless.But this time, I never forgot the existence of the country.
“I won’t turn a blind eye,”Look straight at me.’
An unknown monster was twitching his tongue and trying to swallow it.Shirone recalled Armin’s advice.Never turn a blind eye to it.Armin personally showed the fact that not everyone disappears just because they have infinite keys.
“I’ll get through it.I’ll make sure… I’ll get over it.’
The monster’s gills came over his dark throat.Shirone remained staring at the darkness in his throat without turning his head until that moment.
“Oh my god!”
The spirit that had spread throughout the world hit the Spirit Zone barrier, causing a severe headache.I caught him.Shirone clenched his teeth and survived.All the energy that exceeded the limit was shot at the photon output.
“Shirone! Are you all right?”Say something!”
“Check the output first!”
Nade looked back at the core at the cry of Shirone.Output efficiency was 22 percent. The efficiency, which was not even 0.1 percent, increased by as much as 4 percent.
“Oh! It’s going up, it’s going up!I hate you!”
“Ahhhhaha.
Shirone concentrated even more.The infinite mental force entering through the spirit zone flowed through the arm and was injected into the crystal ball.
Nade exclaimed.Output efficiency 36%!
`More! I need more strength!’More!”
The spirit zone shook.Strong durability could not stop the rush of mental strength.It feels like it’s going to explode hundreds of times compressed.My mind was on the verge of exploding.
“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”
Output efficiency is 59 percent.
“It’s Shirone! A little more!”Cheer up!”
Even the cool-headed Yiruki screamed.The needle of the instrument began to swing from side to side as if it had met a storm.
Shirone transformed the Spirit Zone into a defensive type.As the frame intertwined, I heard a dull and tightening auditory hallucination.As soon as the force that endured the pressure and the injection force from it escaped through the hand, I felt a sense of deprivation as if the world was turning off.
Output efficiency is 87 percent.
“Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
His whole body trembled and his brain shook like crazy.Shirone realized again what a great wizard Armin was.It was really crazy to apply infinite power to reality.If I did something wrong, I would have lost my life by being weighed down by more powerful forces than by Nirvana.
Shirone pushed all his spirits through the only open ejection port in his palm.Even though the exit was completely expanded, the photon’s power had not diminished at all.
Output efficiency is 100 percent.
“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”
As soon as Shirone pulled out his last strength, a red light came into the core lamp.
Nade shuddered before the ridiculous result.The hungry monster, which was only 17 percent of the power of maintaining the photon output for 10 minutes, was now screaming as if his stomach were about to burst.
“That’s it, that’s it!”Eruki, start!”
While watching, Yi Eruki hurriedly grabbed the remote control device.As I pressed the button with my trembling hand, the light went up to the ground along the line.From there, hundreds of fiber optics spread throughout the school like a spider web.
Ring, ring.
A bell rang to announce midnight.
* * *
“It’s already twelve o’clock.Time flies so fast.”
Maria, who was studying at the accommodation, closed the book and stretched out.
I heard a faint sound of a bell outside the window.
Unconsciously, she remembered the presentation, and shook her head hastily to erase her thoughts.
But the more I tried to forget, the more I cared about it.
Nade’s words that anglers appear and eat people still lingered in his mind.
“Well, what is it?It reminds me of nothing.”
Shirone already knew that if you put a keyword on it, you can imagine it on your own.
“If you match the frequency of your soul, you can see ghosts?”
Thoughts clashed in my mind.Maria swept away her spooky body and turned toward the bed.At the same time, my heart dropped with a thud.Pupils shook and intense electrical stimulation climbed up the spine and hit the brain.
“Uh…Uh…Uh….”
A rotten corpse was trudging through the room.
Maria couldn’t control her shivering jaw.
The soldier, whose thin ribs were exposed, turned this way and began to approach with his arms raised.
“Screaming!”
The window shook with a scream.But no one could hear her voice.The same scream echoed from door to door in the corridor.

Clink!
The vase that hit the wall was shattered.
Amy, who threw the vase away, gasped with her arms and legs against the other wall.
“What, what?”
The moment the bell rang, a real ghost appeared.Is this what Nade called resonance?At first I thought I was hallucinating.But what I saw in front of me was a clear reality.
“Well, well….”
As soon as the cry broke out of the ghost’s throat, Amy started a schema and ran to the door.When I opened the door to break, countless girls were running in the hallway screaming.
Amy was astonished.Dozens of ghosts were running behind them, clattering their jaws.
“Amy! Help me!”A ghost has appeared!”
cried Cheriel, with tears and a runny nose.Amy’s face turned pale.I’ve never believed in ghosts.However, when I heard a scary story, I was reluctant to go to the bathroom at night, which was a natural attribute of humans.
“Oh, my!”
Ami, swept away by a wave of crowds, began to run outside the building.
“Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr…
A strange groan broke the silence in the quiet training center located at the entrance of the mountain.
Ethella awoke from meditation.When I stood up and turned around, an ugly, transparent figure was walking toward me.I thought I was a ghost, but there was no special impression in the heart of the old leader who fought against the evil of the world.
Ethella, with her eyes dimly open, looked at the ghost that was just around the corner.Then the ghost tilted his head and looked at her.It was the moment when Eruki’s equation proved how accurate it was.
“Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr…
“Grrr?”
Ethella raised her hand with curious eyes and pressed the soldier’s nose.But, of course, his hand penetrated through the soldier’s head.
“Sigh! Sigh!”
Inside the icy tent, where the steam was frozen, Siena breathed heavily, sadly hiding her body.
On the day she was on duty, she was washing herself in the public bath of the girls’ dormitory.Today, however, I heard the sound of the midnight bell and was surprised enough to break my heart.
“What?”
The first thing that came to mind was the frequency of the soul.Does that mean what Nade said is true?That’s impossible.However, it was impossible to deny that there was nothing visible.
“Well, well…
The monkfish broke through the ice curtain.Thanks to this, Siena regained her composure.I didn’t realize it was a hologram.It was his pride as a wizard that there was no existence to neutralize his icy magic so easily.
“How dare you…….”
She walked forward proudly.As expected, the soldier went through her without causing any harm.
Then the situation was immediately understood.
Siena found two devices installed on the ceiling and walls.A hemispherical device with a diameter of the size of a gold coin emitted thin rays.
She sighed and slowly left the bathroom.
As soon as she came out of the changing room, the water on her body cracked and froze.
When I shook my body lightly, the ice that shone like diamonds spread in all directions.Before I knew it, there was no water left in my body.
“These things are really……!”
Siena’s eyes were torn fiercely.
* * *
The Alpeas School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was in a frenzy.
The dark windows shone one after another, and students were screaming out of the door.
The same situation was created everywhere.
Holograms created by predicting people’s behavior in advance turned freely, and students who were out of their minds were running recklessly without even knowing that they had been deceived.
“Argh! Help me!”
“It’s a ghost! A ghost has appeared!”
The behavior patterns that humans can predict when they are in extreme fear were surprisingly simple.This was because the reason was paralyzed and moved only by emotions.
Children in the lower class cried and called their mothers, and the students in the upper class, separated into men and women, were joining the most crowded side.
In the highlands, a crowd of girls in the senior class, a sparse male student, were rushing down.
The ghosts seemed to be chasing people recklessly, but from heaven, they were focusing on gathering the public into one place.Finally, as many as 400 students gathered in the central park in the north.
The students who were trapped between people and buildings finally realized.The fact that ghosts flock from all directions from all directions, so there is no place to escape.
“Argh! He’s coming!”Do something!”
“Argh! Bring it on! Bring it on, you punks!”
Hundreds of soldiers rushed at them with swords in unison, each screaming with a cry of fear.The crying children, the screaming female students, and the curious male students closed their eyes without exception.
At that moment, the soldiers began to glow.Hundreds of bodies flashed like flashes of lightning and soared into the sky as if they were drawn toward a point.
“What, what?”
The students’ eyes were all on the rooftop of the central building.Shirone was standing on the railing on the roof.Nade and Eruki came up late and sat on the left and right sides.
“Thank you for attending the presentation.”
The students looked at them blankly.I was still at a loss as to what the situation was going on.
The teachers rushed into the park.It was the site where all faculty members were dispatched regardless of low-class, high-class, and graduation classes.
Siena broke through the crowd with a hordes of people.
“You can’t come down at once!”What the hell are you doing?You’ve made a mess of the school!”
Nade greeted her with a wink.
“Oh, Ms. Siena,”Good night.”
“Good night!”Hurry up and come down.If I go up, I might kill you, so come down quickly!”
“But first of all, it’s a presentation.I’ll leave after this.”
Presentation? What presentation in the middle of the night?The children murmured at Nade’s words.
“What? Then they’re all fake?”
“I’ve been fooled! What a jerk!”I thought my heart was going to drop!”
Most of the students were still delirious, but a small number of students who quickly grasped the situation pointed fingers at Shirone and criticized him.
“You scammers!”How dare you cheat on us when it’s Class Five?This isn’t a presentation or anything!”
“They should get zero marks on their performance tests!”Guys, you’re done now!How dare you cheat on me like this?”
Shirone’s party smiled leisurely in the face of a flood of accusations.Then, when there was no sign of stopping the abuse and criticism, Nade raised his hand and calmed them down.
“The Supernatural Psychological Science Society proved the existence of ghosts through a presentation.But you don’t seem to believe it.”
“Of course! Did you think you could make a ghost that doesn’t exist and deceive it and get recognition?”I’m sure you’ll fail.”
“Yes! This is just a bad joke!”Anyone can cheat like this!As long as I make up my mind…….”
The boy in Class Four stopped talking and blinked.The other children, perhaps aware of this, began to turn around and murmur.
“But… how did you do it?”Do you understand?”
“No, I don’t even have a clue.”I felt like I was really alive.”Besides, you deceived all 400 students.”
The children realized that the incident was not just a joke.
It was surprising enough to create hundreds of holograms, but how they moved them was still a mystery.
“They’re…What the hell did you do?”
When the disturbance broke out among the students, Siena frowned and closed her eyes.To be honest, it was not yet known exactly what method she had used either.
It was impossible to immediately recall that Nade’s excellent volume production, engineering technology, photon output from infinite fields, and equations ranging from tens of thousands of lines of servant syndrome were combined.
“Haha. It looks like we got a shot this time.”
The teachers turned around in unison.
Alpeas burst into laughter and looked up at Shirone’s party.
Siena shook her head and approached.
“It’s no laughing matter, Principal,”I don’t know what they did, but there’s evidence that they broke into a forbidden area.A kind of hologram device…….”
“Whoa? You mean Ms. Siena doesn’t know?”
Alpeas thought it was worth it.If he had not also majored in the magic of light, he would not have immediately realized that information transmission technology was used in this strategy.
But is this possible at the student level?
In a way, it must have been a gamble for Shirone’s party.Alpeas wanted to praise that part.
Siena admitted frankly.
“I’m ashamed, but I still don’t understand.But I don’t think they persuaded the teacher just because they didn’t understand the mechanism.”
“Well, I must have said something wrong,”That’s not what it means to be shot.”
“What? Well…?”
Alpheas looked up at the students, silent.
“Let’s watch it first.I don’t think the presentation is over yet.”
The students were still quarreling over the tricks used by Shirone’s party.
In an instant, the central park turned into a large-scale forum.
However, the more we shared our opinions, the more mysterious they were.In particular, the students of Class Four were displeased.His pride was not so hurt at a time when he was completely deceived by tricks made by his juniors and could not even grasp the mechanism.
“Well, you don’t have to think about it!”I’m sure you’ve done something funny.The point is that this presentation is a sham!You showed me a ghost that doesn’t exist and proved it?Don’t make me laugh!”
The students of the Class Four united and agreed.
“Yes! I don’t understand this way!”It’s not psychology, it’s just a show!”
As the voices of criticism rose, Nade stepped forward as a representative and asked them.
“Can’t you still acknowledge the existence of course.
“Of course! Ghosts?”This is just a kind of illusion magic!I’m not really a ghost!”
“Well, I’ll ask,”If you really think so, why are you here right now?”
“What? Of course he is……!”
The silence began with the silence of the students.
None of the hundreds of students could refute what Nade said.If they thought ghosts didn’t exist, why did they run away like fools?
The answer was simple.This is because there is an idea in the heart that cannot deny the soul.
“What you feel now is the essence of supernatural psychic science.Humans live with questions and curiosity about the unknown throughout their lives.If you don’t need to know that it hasn’t been verified yet, why should intelligence exist?I think that’s why the Research Society of Supernatural Psychic Sciences should be located at the Alpeas School of Magic, the cradle of intelligence.”
The students became speechless.
The ghost didn’t actually appear, but what does it matter?
The important thing is that everyone here thinks that ghosts may exist.And if you think so, someone must try to find out the truth.
Nade’s words made the students think seriously about the presentation for the first time.It wasn’t just a joke to make the school noisy.The Psychological Science Research Society presented a perfect presentation in their own way.
“That concludes the presentation of the Psychological Science Research Council.I would like to thank all of you for coming so late.”
Shirone’s party bowed politely.The son-in-law was silent and no one spoke.

However, after a while, the students who felt the unidentifiable pleasure rising from their hearts began to burst into laughter.
“Hahaha! This is a masterpiece!”Yes, you’ve done it!”
“Yes! To be honest, I’ve always been interested in this!”Please hold more fun presentations!”
“It’s been a long time since I’ve sweated.You won!It’s the best!”
The teachers were bewildered by the sudden change in the students’ behavior, but Shirone had already expected it.Every human being with reason has a curiosity about the essence.
Where are we from and where are we going?
Perhaps that is the most important question for humans.Also, that was why the supernatural psychological science research society should exist.
Alpeas nodded contentedly.
“I show you what I can’t see without seeing it.”I didn’t know there was such a way.The children have done a wonderful job.”
“Do you intend to keep the Psychological Science Society alive, Principal?”
“Well, that’s not my decision.What do you think?If anyone has any objection to the children’s argument, give it a try now.”
None of the teachers came forward.Even Siena had no choice but to shut up this time.
To tell the truth, I felt like I had been properly beaten by my disciples.The Psychological Science Research Society must exist.Hundreds of students gathered here were proving the fact.
Sadr raised an objection.
“But what if you find out that you broke the school rules?”There must be a lot of resistance.It’s a bit uncomfortable to approve the research group as it is.”
There were quite a few teachers who confirmed illegal entry into prohibited areas like Siena.When several people pointed out the same part, the teachers’ meeting was held on the spot.
Siena first gave her opinion.
“It’s true that children have obviously broken the school rules.But I think this is separate from whether the research group will survive.”
Teachers looked surprised when she, who had been at the forefront of dismantling just a while ago, defended the research group.
But she thought it was enough.It was an appointment with them.Shirone’s party met the requirements and all she had to do was acknowledge the achievements.
Apart from the teachers’ discussions, members of the Dark Research Society were secretly talking in the secluded part of the park.
“Even if it’s rotten, it’s not over yet.You’ve left your graduates behind, you know, pretty bold, right?”
“There will be no war.For the time being, the beginner’s meeting will continue to be strong.Let’s not take part in the Ant Language Research Society.”
“Well, it’s still a five,”I’ll be in my senior year one day, but I won’t be in this school by then.”
“I don’t think it’s fair to say he.If I fail this year, I might compete with them next year.”
“What? So I run away because I’m scared of them?”
“Quit it all,”It’s funny that we don’t even meet face to face.If you want to try it, you can try it, right?Of course, our hide-and-seek research group won’t take part.”
“I’m sure you’ll keep an eye on every move you make after all that.You go into the water to hide it, don’t you?”
“That’s all I’ve got to say.”It’s because people’s eyes are interested in it’s because of that.This gathering will only hurt the reputation of the research group.”
The heads of the magic school decided to reach an agreement and headed to the graduation building.The forehead of Siena, who caught them walking together, was wrinkled.
“Well, those nerds,”’
I’m sick and tired of just looking at his face.They were the worst troublemakers who had bullied Siena until she entered the senior class after going through the lower and higher classes.
Nevertheless, the reason why I couldn’t do anything was that I abused the talent given by heaven and hid my tail like a ghost.
“How many kids are like that in this school?”This is all because they acknowledge the ridiculous research group.’
How will the teacher deal with the genius tricks that the seniors to the juniors, and the juniors to the juniors again?
The reason why Siena tried to dismantle the Psychic Science Research Society was not because she hated Nade’s party, but because she wanted to cut off the root of evil in the first place.
“But it ended up like this.”
Siena clapped her tongue through the crowd.and cried out to Shirone, who was standing on the railing on the roof.
“We announce the results of the school council meeting.”
The applause and cheers of the students died down.
“The Supernatural Psychological Science Research Society was to be disbanded soon.This is because there was no official activity for a year and there was a shortage of people.However, as of today’s presentation, after discussion by principal Alpeas and many teachers, the three research groups representing Nade and the research group on supernatural psychology have been decided to continue for the time being.But… “
Siena choked up as she tried to continue talking.No matter how many times I thought about it, I was annoyed, and I shouted, pointing my finger.
“You three will be kept on guard for a week!””Suspension, you idiots!”
(Laughs)
The children burst into laughter.The idea to prove the research group was excellent, but it was a crime of installing unauthorized machinery in schools in the process.
Shirone, Nade and Eruki opened their mouths in a daze.Then we looked back at each other.The corners of his mouth went up, and his eyes filled with joy.
“Done! I succeeded!”
“Hahaha! We did it!”I kept the research group!”
He didn’t care about suspension.Looking at his disciples hugging him excitedly, she was absurd.
However, they did their best and had no regrets.I was truly happy with the current result because I poured everything out without leaving a percentage.
“Hahaha! Hey, congratulations!Keep up the good work!”
“Where’s the lab?”I’ll come and see you once in a while!”
The students congratulated them.Among them were Mark and Seriel, who were enthusiastic followers of Shirone.
“Ah! Shirone! I knew it! I knew from the beginning that it wouldn’t end like this!”As expected, you’re one level higher than me! No, two levels higher than me!”
“Yes, the existence of the conference was at stake in the presentation.I didn’t even dream about it.Anyway, I did a great job this time, too, right?Aren’t you, Amy?”
Amy was supposed to be the happiest at this moment, but unexpectedly she had a sulky look on her face.
“Why are you so happy to be suspended?”Why do you do such a pathetic thing?It’s not enough to study quickly and get into graduation.”
She looked lovingly at Amy, who was not good at expressing herself.There was no way that she didn’t understand her desire to go to school with Shirone.
“But isn’t it wonderful?”Of course, if you ask me to do it, I can never do it, but everyone thinks that once in a while.I want to surprise the world.”
She looked at Shirone with envy.
Shirone’s face, smiling brightly at the cheers of the children, showed no concern.
Amy’s eyes were filled with longing feelings.She knew the truth.I know that I am the one who wants to stand next to Shirone more than anyone else.
But she shook her head as if to ignore her feelings.
“Well, I don’t have time to do this to graduate.I will never look up to you.’
I want to be with Shirone.I want to climb up that high and smile the happiest in the world.Suppressing the thought, Amy turned away.
“So… Come with me now, you idiot.”’
* * *
It’s 4 a.m.
It was a deep night when all the night shift workers left work and all the students and teachers were asleep.
Shirone’s party lay in the meadow of the central park, where the historic presentation took place, looking at the stars.
The children’s cheers and loud noises disappeared, but they still seemed to hear auditory hallucinations.
said Nade, in a hoarse voice.
“In the end, we did it, we did it.”
“I know, but I’m a little sorry for Shirone.”You say I’m on a diet, but it’s your first time, isn’t it?”
Shirone giggled.It didn’t matter.
“But it was interesting.It was so much fun.”
“Yes, it was the best.Will I be able to experience a day like today again in my life?I still can’t forget the cheers of the people.”
“The three of us have joined forces, and it should be as good as that.for, in any case, a new history has been engraved in the Alpeas School of Witchcraft.”
Shirone sprang to his feet.
“And it’s not all that bad.I’ve gained a lot of things, too.This presentation has raised the level of photon output tremendously.I think it’s going to work in my senior year.”
“Me, too. I’ve gained the knowledge of fiber optics, and above all, I’ve experienced the mass production process by myself.To be honest, I learned a lot.This is all thanks to you.”
“I feel the same way,”I’ve gained a lot from applying 400 behavior patterns to practice.It would have been absolutely impossible if he hadn’t used the function.”
“What are you talking about?”You’re the best.Students would never have been deceived without the Servant syndrome’s behavioral equation.”
“In that way, Nade made a great deal of trouble.I’ve installed hundreds of mechanical devices without errors.His concentration is incredible.”
Shirone’s party, excitedly speaking, realized something and shut up at the same time.For a moment, the cold wind passed by.said Nade, laying back the body he had raised.
“Let’s stop. What’s the point of complimenting each other?”
“Well, you can’t be a frog in a well.It’s natural to enjoy results, but don’t let your guard down.”
Shirone looked at the shining stars as if they were pouring down.
“I want to go up further,”You have to be the brightest star.”
Eruki felt the same way.
“I think we’ve done everything we can while we’re playing.I think it’s about time we went up.I mean, in my senior year.”
Nade sprang to his feet while tumbling.
“Well, then, let’s set a new goal!”Let’s raise the class as soon as possible!And you graduate at the same time!Let’s have fun in the real world!”
Shirone and Eruki nodded.
“All right. Until then, don’t stop and run.”
“LOL. I’m so motivated after a long time”.
The three of them put their hands together and cheered.
Someday you will be the best wizard.Their eyes twinkled like stars as they looked up at the night sky with such determination.
the only brightest star
The North Star looked down at them.
normally (1)
When Shirone returned to his quarters, he collapsed immediately and fell asleep.It is a pity that he was suspended for a week, but mental and physical fatigue was too great to feel that way.
The day went by without a matter of fact.
The sound of the piano in the morning, the sun floating in the sky, had nothing to do with Shirone, who had been suspended.
“Hey, it’s Shirone.It’s Shirone.”
Shirone opened his eyes frowning at the sight of someone shaking his body.Two dim personalities flickered, and Nade and Eruki’s smiling faces were seen.
“Hmm. What is it?”
“You’re very good, too,”Are you still sleeping?”
“I don’t know. I’m tired.Get out of here.”
“Don’t do that, get up!”We can’t even take lessons anyway.Don’t do that, let’s go play.”
“Are you going out to play?”
“There’s a casino Eruki knows, where they give you free drinks and there are a lot of pretty girls.Now that we’ve done this, let’s get a decent share of it’s
Shirone didn’t even want to answer back from the moment he heard that it was a casino.
“Aren’t you tired?”I’m going to die.”
“We slept all day, too.You’ve been sleeping for 27 hours.Don’t do that. I’ll be back in three days.If you’re a servant, you can make money in no time.”

Shirone knew that those who were so-called experts would go to such places and get their underwear ripped off.Of course, with Eruki’s servant ability, no one would be able to compete in probability calculation, but there is a reason why people call it gambling.Probability is just probability, and winning gambling required the temperament of a winner who knew how to win.It was clearly depicted that Eruki was robbed at once while picking money little by little.
“I’m not going. You’re going out.”I don’t gamble or anything.”
“You don’t have to gamble,”I hear pretty girls pour you drinks and rub your shoulders. Are you sure you don’t want to go?”
When he heard it, he became more reluctant to go.
“Oh, I’m sorry. I’m really very tired.I’m going to keep sleeping.Have a good time.”
As long as Shirone said sorry, I could not change my mind.In other words, Shirone was the most tired person while preparing for the presentation.Nade and Eruki also lacked sleep time, but the work they focused on was divided into manual labor and intellectual labor.
On the other hand, Shirone, who had to raise the level of photon output, had to continue high-level training for a month that consumed both the body and mind.In addition, at the end, he entered the realm of infinity and poured out his mental strength, so it was natural that his mind and body were weakened.
“Yes, I see,”Then take a good rest.Anyway, we’ll be back, so that’s what we know.”
“Yes, go and get a lot of them.Buy me something delicious.”
“Hahaha! Don’t worry!When we wake up, we’ll be rich like magic.”
Hearing the door close, Shirone buried his face in bed again.
“You’re rich anyway, but you’re making a fuss…”….’
Shirone fell into a deep sleep again.
* * *
That night.
“Well, well, well,”
Shirone tossed and turned in a cold sweat.A nightmare that did not come when I fell asleep as if I were faint was rising above my consciousness again as I filled my consciousness.
“Well…”
Shirone frowned and shook his head from side to side.In the vast universe, humans were nothing.The empty sense of deprivation enveloped Shirone in a powerful shock.
This time, the nightmare was drawn into one spot.Time went backwards and we reached the beginning of the universe.The light was visible, and the light was a swaying thread, which turned back into a bubble and filled Shirone’s vision.It was only the light.And the next moment, a powerful explosion broke out in the empty space of nothing.
“Gasp!”
Shirone raised his upper body.His wide open eyes were still staring at the afterimage in his memory.Only after the sweaty pajamas conveyed a damp feeling did they slowly turn to the window.
It was a chirping morning when I heard birds chirping.
“Oh, I thought you were just walking by.”
I had a nightmare beyond doubt.My body trembled as a strange sensation enveloped my whole body.
But Shirone was no longer afraid.
He heard the cause from Armin, and on the day of the presentation, he escaped from the realm of infinity at his will.
When he was able to control his power to some extent, Shirone calmly watched what had happened to him.
“The universe you see in your dreams.”It is certainly a sight that marks the beginning of the universe.And the gauge symmetry.”
Although there was no logical information, I felt a vague sense of being caught.Perhaps it is the work of organizing information that occurs unconsciously.When I thought of Armin, who said he realized himself, my mind calmed down and my sense of portrait disappeared.
Shirone went into the bathroom.When I slept so deeply that I didn’t even know how many days had passed, my condition was quite good.Looking back on their memories while brushing their teeth, it seemed that Eruki and Nade had stopped by.
“Is it a dream? Or did he really go?”
The faces of the two men who said they would go to the casino and hit the jackpot were blurred.
`I’d rather go with you,’What should I do alone now?’
After leaving the bathroom while brushing his teeth, Shirone suddenly looked back at the bed and stopped.The little dust floating on the bed was spinning.The window was closed, so it was not a convection.
Forgot to brush his teeth, Shirone ran away, foaming.When I looked closely, I saw that it was definitely.I reached out to the center of the revolution.The moment I thought I couldn’t feel anything, I suddenly felt a strong sense of portrait.
“Oh my god!”
Shirone bent his upper body, throwing up his teeth foam.
What could it be?
I felt as if I had touched the nerves of the tooth-pulled spot for the first time as if I had confirmed what I knew.
“This is it! I already know it, but I don’t know its name. But what is this?”
Shirone motioned wildly in the air.But I could no longer feel the strange sensation.After calming himself down, Shirone went back into the bathroom and washed himself out in hot water.In the meantime, I kept thinking about the phenomenon I had just discovered.
“Not the wind, not the air, not the temperature.But how can dust move?’
It wasn’t just floating around.Obviously, it was moving in the form of a rotational force by some force.
Shirone, who had been lost in thought for over an hour, changed his clothes and went out.There were no students outside the building because the class was in full swing.
Feeling unfamiliar, Shirone went to the front door.Having been suspended for a week, I was free to do anything for the next four days.As long as the water had already been spilled, Shirone decided to use this time as a break after the special training.
“But where should I go?”
The first thing that came to my mind was my house.When I remembered my parents’ faces, I strongly wanted to go.
“No, that’s ridiculous.”
It took half a day to get there by carriage, but there was no justification.”Mom, Dad, I’ve been suspended,” she said, and she couldn’t enter the house.However, it would be awkward to stop by the House of Ozent in the absence of Liane and Reina.
“Oh, yes!”
Shirone suddenly realized where he was going and flicked his finger.
It was a bookstore.
Of course, there are so many books in the school library that it is overflowing, but it has been Shirone’s long-cherished dream to buy books at a bookstore.
Suddenly, when I remembered that I was happy with the old book my father bought me as a child, I smiled around my mouth.
I enjoyed a book, but in fact, I had a desire to buy more books.
But now I can do it.It was thanks to the considerable accumulation of allowance that Temuran sends every month.
If I bought a book in a commoner’s area, I would have been able to put the book in a basket even if I had used it a little less.
“That’s the first time I’ve bought it,”My own book.’
It’s not a bad idea to borrow it from the library, but Shirone, who likes books, has a unique possessive desire.
Having made up his mind, he accelerated his steps.In an instant, he passed through the noble district and entered the common people’s district.
The town where I often came by my father’s cart when I was a child still remained the same.Shirone knocked on the bag of gold coins and Bo-moo entered the bookstore with confidence.The lady recognized Shirone.Every time I entered the city, my face was memorable because I was a child who stood up and looked inside for hours.
“Welcome…Oh, isn’t it Shirone’s?”
“Good morning, madam,”
“Well, you’re so big that you don’tI thought your dad had left for another city because he hasn’t seen much lately.He always bought me a book every time he came.”
“He won’t come any more.So I’m going to buy it myself.”
“Yes, you still love books.Choose one.”
“Well, I’ll look around.”
Shirone walked around the bookstore smiling happily.There was a price tag everywhere the books were stacked, but from what I looked at, books in good condition were expensive regardless of the content.
There were only a few commoners who could read, but in large cities such as Creas, the number of people was still quite good.
However, there were also many novels that sold better than academic books, and occasional academic books only dealt with basic fields.I could see that the books in the Alpeas Magic School Library were much more advanced than expected.Although he doesn’t have a book related to his major, he likes all books anyway, so he looked at this and that and bought a novel with a wizard as the main character.
There were several books that seemed to be quite popular, and according to their quality, they were divided into high, medium, and low prices.Shirone, who could afford the money, chose the cleanest new book and offered her a gold coin.It is a bookstore where ordinary people go, so the price is cheap, but books were originally valuable.Moreover, since it was a new book, the price was ten times the lowest quality.
“Oh, how can you buy such an expensive one?””Who’s here for an errand?”
“No, it’s actually my first book.So I’d like to read something clean, even if it’s a little too much.”
“Well, I’m proud of you.Not many people spend money on books.Anyway, do your best to read it carefully.That’s how you’ll be smart.If you’re smart, you won’t get married later and make your wife suffer.”
The woman, who had no idea that Shirone was attending a magic school, the cradle of geniuses, made a speech with the pride of the bookstore owner.But Shirone seemed to be in a good mood, and readily listened, and came out with a book.
“This is my book.”
My own book, neither borrowed nor read by others.The weight of the book made my heart flutter like a child.
“Huh? Isn’t that Shirone?”
Shirone looked aside at the voice calling for him.A group of children were gathered in a cart.His eyes opened wide, as he looked closely at the familiar appearance.
“Oh, Althor? Martin?”Lumina, too?
They were children from Hwajeonmin Village who were suitable for their childhood.
“Are you really Shirone?”
Children flocked to Shirone.Most of them were the same age, and they were one or two years old at the most.However, his size has changed beyond recognition.In particular, Altor, the leader of slash-and-burn children, has grown into a giant that even adults cannot handle.Martin, who had always been dwarfed, was similar to Shirone.
Altor put it between Shirone’s head and arm.
“You little thing!”What the hell is going on?I haven’t visited you in years.When I asked Uncle Vincent, he only said he lived in the city.”
“Hahaha. I’m sorry.That’s what happened.”
Their greeting was tingling for the first time in a while, but Shirone was also pleased.Martin, whose front teeth protruded like rabbits, looked at Shirone’s dress and said admirably,
“Wow. You’ve made your way.It seems to me that he is a nobleman.”
“Really? I don’t know.”
Shirone was surprised to hear that he looked like a nobleman.It was because I had never thought about it before.However, while living in a magic school through the House of Ozent, it seemed that the smell of aristocrats had penetrated.
said Lumina, the only woman in the party.
“Shirone’s always looked like a nobleman.Anyway, I’m glad you’re doing well.”
“Well, thank you, Lumina.You’ve become beautiful, too.”
Lumina’s face flushed.As Shirone remembers, Lumina was a child with a lot of freckles and plump cheeks.However, now her skin has become a little darker, and her freckles have disappeared, and she has lost all her weight, so she looks like a perfect girl.
Altor burst into laughter.
“You’ve got more lies, Shirone!”You’re right. There were no children who could stand your horse’s foot.What’s so beautiful about this woofy girl?”
“Be quiet! Who are you to judge me by saying I’m a walnut?”
When Lumina became more angry than ever, Altor felt awkward.
“No, I’m just joking…….”
“Well, I don’t want to talk to you.”
“Yes! Don’t say it.I’m ashamed to hang out with a girl like you!”
Shirone felt better after a long time as he recalled his old memories.At first glance, it seems to be a fight, but this was the daily life of children in Hwajeon Minchon.

“By the way, it’s Shirone said.What have you been up to lately?What do you do in the city?Do you work in a store?”
“Huh? No, that’s…….”
Shirone decided to tell the truth.I knew my father was silent, but when I asked, I couldn’t deal with them so coldly as to lie.
“In fact, I go to a magic school.”
“What?”
All the children shouted with their eyes wide open.
It was incredible.Of course, I’ve known since I was a child that Shirone was extraordinary, but I can’t believe that the child of Shirone is entering a magic school.
“Oh, what’s going on.Are you serious.
Shirone was surprised that the children were more surprised than expected.said he, deliberately, in order to calm them down.
“Ha-ha. That’s my luck.I once worked as a librarian for a noble family, and fortunately, I was admitted to the school thanks to your family’s favorable views.”
The children were more absent-minded when they heard the story.
No matter how much he worked as a librarian, no aristocrat could do that for the common people.
It was natural that anyone who did not know how difficult Shirone had gone through to get here would not understand.
“Well, anyway, that’s great.Are you learning magic now?”
“Wow! Magic!Can you use magic?Huh? Try it! Show us!”
The children cried out, “Everyone is different,” and Shirone had to sweat for a long time to calm them down.
“Well… I can’t do it well because my class is still low.And if you use magic outside of school, it’s against the school rules.”
Altor glanced doubtfully at Shirone.To be honest, I couldn’t believe it.Since childhood, Shirone’s fine appearance and character have aroused awe in children.Nevertheless, Altor was able to become a leader because he had the most important force for the common people.
But what about now?
Shirone became a student at a magic school where only the most noble people attended, and he was still only an Altor of the Hwajeon Minchon.
“Why are you here if you’re going to a magic school?”Aren’t you supposed to be studying right now?”
“Oh, that’s… I just came out on vacation.I had a tough exam the other day, so I’m going to take a break.”
I had no choice but to lie this time.If you say you’ve been suspended, your father will hear you.Even if it was a good thing, it was clear that my parents would be disappointed.
Most of the children seemed to believe.Since I’ve never been to school, I thought it was easy to give a vacation.
said Lumina, grasping Shirone’s collar.
“How many days do you take off on vacation?”
“Well, I don’t know. About three days?”
“Really? Are you going home then?”
“Haha, no.The semester is coming to an end soon, so I’ll go home then.I’m sure your parents are busy, too.
“Well, in three days you’ll be here.”The holidays are coming to an end.”
They with the same parents knew better than anyone how busy the living people were.
said Martin.
“Have you decided where to go?”Where are you going to sleep?”
“Well, that’s…I haven’t decided anything yet.”
exclaimed Lumina, smiling.
“Really? Then come with us.You used to sleep a lot.”
Shirone was fascinated by the words.Even if I went back to school, I couldn’t borrow books from the library because I was suspended, and all I could do was lie down in the accommodation and kill time.But I didn’t want to spend the night alone in this place where I didn’t know anyone.
“Will it be okay if I go?”
“What are you talking about?”We still sleep together at my friends’ house every other day.”
I remembered Shirone, too.Familiar with community life, they were friends, brothers, lovers, and family.
“Yes, of course,”I’d like to see you, too, for the first time in a while.”
“Come on! Now that you’ve sold out, let’s go!”Let’s have a big beer!”
Altor walked to the cart with his arms around Shirone’s head.Shirone’s pain was heard by a much stronger force than usual.
“Ouch. It hurts.”
“Hahaha! You’re still so clumsy, can’t you?To be a good wizard, you need physical strength.”
Shirone knew that this behavior was a way to sort out the ranks and regain the authority of the leader.I didn’t feel bad about it.It was Shirone, who lived as a child of a goon who lived all his life and understood their lives.
Altor put Shirone on the cart and burned him.No matter how small it was, it was impossible to lift an adult man without considerable force.When he stared blankly at the thought that his childhood friend had become a monster, Altor stroked Shirone’s head and burst into laughter.
“Good to see you, Siri!”Let’s drink with a crooked nose today!”
* * *
Shirone, who came into Hwajeon Mincheon by cart, was impressed by the scene he hadn’t seen in a long time.Green shoots sprouted in the fields along the ridge, and smoke rose from the chimney of the mountain village along the ridge.The potters found a cart coming along the path and shouted.
“Martin! Are you coming now?”
“Yes, old man!Shirone came with me too!”
“What? You’re sick, aren’t you?”What about Vincent?”
“Uncle Vincent is not here.But, mister, do you know that?Shirone is attending a magic school now!”
“What? You’re eating around?”
“No! I’m not eating. I’m attending a magic school!”
“Hahaha! That’s not true either.”
“……”
Martin shut up, and the old man plowed the field again.Altor understood his uncle.How can he believe it when he has lived his whole life cultivating the land when he can’t even believe it now?
Lumina pouted her lips.
“Why don’t you believe me?”Don’t worry, Shirone.I’ll tell you later.”
“Ha-ha. That’s not necessary.”
said Altor.
“You didn’t say anything, did you?”Don’t come forward for nothing, just shut up!
As the leader of the children of slash-and-burners, Altor knew the horror of words.If Shirone is lying, Vincent’s position will be difficult.
“If I lose my business with Uncle Vincent, my family will suffer.’
Altor, who put a cart in a public warehouse, took his children to the only store in Hwajeon Minchon that sells alcohol.All I had was a pillar on the ground and a few tables, but the wife of the herbalist was a side job.
“Madam, I’m here.”
“Welcome, Althor,”Oh, aren’t you Shirone?”
“How have you been, madam?”
“Yes, indeed,”Vincent said he works in the city, so I guess he met you there.Anyway, I’m glad you’re here.”
The children were accustomed to attaching three tables.Althor, seated at the head of the table, placed an order.
“I’d like a beer for now, and I’ll have the usual side dish.”
Shirone felt a sense of separation.When they used to hang out, they were all children who couldn’t even drink alcohol.But now he sat with his legs crossed like an adult, gulping down beer.Compared to their appearance, the children at the magic school were still children.
“What do you say, Shirone?”Do you drink well?”
“Huh? Oh, no.I haven’t tried it yet.”
“What? Now that I’ve seen you, you’re still a little boy.You don’t even have hair there, do you?(Laughs)
The children burst into laughter at Altor’s joke.But Lumina, a woman, was as serious as she was.
“What do you mean to a friend you haven’t seen in a long time?”But that’s the only way you’ve got a big mouth.
Althor’s face turned slightly red when I gave him a slap on the face while openly siding with Shirone.
“Well… it’s been like that for a long ago.
I’ve known Lumina likes Shirone since I was a child.But not everyone is a child now.The powerful have a wonderful woman.Altor thought that Lumina’s partner should be himself, the next mayor.Still, I was so happy that my unpleasant feelings quickly swept away by my drunkenness.Shirone was also happy to meet his friends after a long time.The beer I drank for the first time was surprisingly good, so the atmosphere of excitement continued.
“Do you know that Hauran used to run at Shirone?”
“Hey, why are you bringing that up all of a sudden.Don’t do it!”
Shirone, who was drunk, stirred his hand to dry Martin.
“What’s wrong with that? It’s all in the past.Besides, Hauran got married last year, so she’s not even here.”
“Oh, really? That’s a good thing.”
The children burst into laughter at Shirone’s words and struck the table with laughter.As the atmosphere rose, Lumina clung to Shirone with a spirit of drink.
“What kind of girl is Shirone’s ideal type?”
“Huh? Well, I haven’t thought about it yet.”
Alto deliberately spoke to Shirone because there was no way to stop Lumina from making a fool of him.
“Shirone. Are you really going to a magic school?”Then shouldn’t you at least be able to do simple magic?”
“Well, you know, actually, I learned magic late, so I’m behind the other kids.Magic itself is a very difficult discipline.It’s not that I can’t do it at all, but it’s forbidden by the school rules….”
Even if he could do magic, he was definitely a student.Unless you obtain a formal wizard certificate, the use of magic outside of school is strictly prohibited.The exception was when they were threatened with life or when others were exposed to danger.
Of course, I know that most students do not follow the school rules and that there is no way to prevent them realistically, but there is a reason why the school rules were created.
He was Shirone, who broke the limbs of bullies he met in the alley at the age of 12.The other day, Nade’s sudden use of magic at the restaurant could have turned into a big fight if the opponent had come out a little stronger.
Magic is not just force.It was a powerful power that elicited the power of Mother Nature with the human spirit.
The photon output, Shirone’s main specialty, does not have a gram of physical force, but the moment it is introduced, it is known that fear and awe sprout in children’s minds.I didn’t want to make the atmosphere weird by showing magic at a drinking party.
Martin asked, chewing the dried jerky.
“If it’s that hard, can a wizard be bad?”
“Of course, there are much worse people than wizards.”
“Really? If the Wizard doesn’t work, how will you make money?”
“Huh? How……?”
I had never seriously considered the situation when I failed because I had been running towards becoming a wizard.
Making a living by making money was the biggest concern of children of this age, so Shirone tilted his head when he couldn’t answer.
“Then who will pay for the tuition?”Do the nobles give you that, too.
“Well, I’ve got some support for now.”
The children’s eyes were wide open.
“Wow! Really?How much?Did you save some money?How are you going to get married?Have you dated nobles?”
“No, I’ve never thought about it…….”
“Have you been there?”I mean the store with a lot of girls.The nobles, however, come in and out of course.
“Well… there are people like that, but not necessarily.”….”
Althor’s impression was crushed by the children’s enthusiastic questions and answers.Hasn’t it become as if Shirone was the leader?
The order of Hwajeonminchon was not just set to hit and lay weak children.Without the control of a powerful leader, people become greedy to have a larger share.
For them who are isolated from society, discord means the collapse of a group.The reason for choosing leaders since childhood was also to prepare for the time when they grew up and had to take responsibility for the village.
said Althor in a sour voice.
“Stop it. Why do you have so many questions?”Do you envy the life of Shirone?”
“Of course I envy you.The nobles will pay for it.”

[70] At the top (4).
“But if you don’t become a wizard, you’ll be flattered.Don’t you think so, Shirone?”
“Huh? Oh, of course it is.”
“To do something with other people’s money is to leave your life to others.It doesn’t matter if you succeed, but if you fail, there’s nothing left.”Shirone, you shouldn’t do that either.You should find a way to make a living for your parents and learn magic.Are you going to live off your parents for the rest of your life?But that doesn’t mean you’re strong enough to work.”
Even if you don’t become a wizard, you can get a job with the knowledge you have learned.He was a commoner anyway, so there were many places to call Shirone if he bent his pride.But it was also true that he had never considered a failure, as Althor said.
How is that possible?Is it Bae Sujin or pride?If I couldn’t become a wizard, what kind of life would I have?
I felt nauseous.Failure. Anyone could fail, and Shirone was no exception.Shirone’s heart was chilled by realistic questions from children in Hwajeon Minchon.
When the mood subsided, Altor suggested a game.On the other hand, it was also a proposal to regain his authority as a leader.
“Well, that’s enough of a complicated story.Hey, it’s Shirone.Should we arm wrestle for the first time in a while?
“Huh? With me?”
“Yes, you used to be an unexpectedly big man.Let’s see if there’s any bone left.”
The children knocked on the table to incite a confrontation.
“Oh! Warrior vs Wizard!”It’s the fight of the century!”
As the atmosphere of the drinking party heated up, Shirone gave up his melancholy thoughts and regained his laughter.Arm wrestle with a grown-up.Apart from pride, it was just absurd.
“What do you think? Pay for the drinks?”
When Altor put his thick forearms on the table, Shirone held out his hand without losing.The man’s pride was that he had no choice but to accept the bet, whether he lost or won.
“Well, let’s give it a try.You can’t let it slide for me.”
“Of course,”
The moment they held hands together, Shirone felt as if he were holding a block of stone.If you walk over the photonization magic, the price of alcohol is a waste, but it was only an interesting imagination.
Martin volunteered to be the referee.
“Now, get ready……start!”
Shirone pulled out all his might.However, Altor’s strength was like a wave, and he went over to the other side regardless of his will.Falling under the table, he stroked his elbow.It was not a force, but a numerical strength.
“Ouch, that’s really strong.”
“Wow! That’s Althor.Shirone’s a wizard, but you’ve done it all at once.”
Magic has nothing to do with arm wrestling, but for children, the name wizard seemed to have a lot of weight.
“Of course! Altor has hunted bears before!”
Only then did Altor, who regained his authority, burst into laughter.
“Hahaha! You’re really weak, aren’t you?”It wasn’t like this before.This has become a strange bet.I’ll just buy the wine, Shirone.”
Lumina came up and helped Shirone.Her eyes were filled with apologetic feelings.
“Shirone, are you all right?”Anyway, it’s Altor.How can you be so ignorant?”
She was a member of the Hwajeon Minchon, so there was no way that she didn’t know why Altor overcame it violently.However, Shirone was not disappointed because he was also familiar with the life of a mountain goon.
“It’s all right, but Altor is really strong.”
The moment Shirone stood up, the bag of gold fell off.As his mouth opened, gold coins with lovely names rolled around.The eyes of the children in Hwajeon Minchon were wide open.
“Oh, this is a real gold coin!”
“What? Where? Where?”Wow! Really! There are five!
Even the children at the end of the table gathered, fascinated by the gold coins.It was rare for adults to use gold coins in Hwajeon Minchon.The golden coin seemed sacred to children who still earned a small sum of money from their leisure activities.
“You’ve got a lot of money.”Why do you carry five gold coins?”
said Cironet, shyly picking up the gold coins.
“I brought a lot just in case,”I really want to buy a book, but if I don’t have money, I’m in trouble.”
“But books are expensive.”
The children knew that Shirone liked books.for he had always had a book on his side when he came with Vincent.The people of Hwajeonminchon, who did not know how to write, were not interested in books.However, I could tell just by looking at the number of gold coins that fell, how great Shirone was living.
“It’s Shirone. Can I use it however I want?”Since it’s yours, you’ll buy whatever you want to buy, right?
Shirone looked troubled.I’ve never wasted money before.Because, as Altor said, the money was received from others.However, the children seemed shocked just to have a huge amount of money.I carefully chose my words because I thought they might hurt their lives.
“I hardly ever have to spend my money.Most of the time, I skip meals because I have so many classes at school.”
“Well, you can still pay for the drink, can’t you?”for I lost the bet.”
“A bet? Oh, right.”
Shirone heard clearly what Altor had said he would pay, but he thought it would make him even more upset if he showed a coin and pretended not to know.Altor was also ignorant, although he knew nothing, so he left the atmosphere to the natural flow.
“All right, I’ll pay you.You lost, so what?”
The children cheered at Shirone’s words.
“Yes! Then we’ll use gold coins, right?”Shirone, can you give me the money in advance for the drink?In fact, I’ve never touched a gold coin before.”
“I’ll pay the bill.It was my lifelong wish to give out gold coins.
“No! I’ll do it!”
Before I knew it, the children’s leader was Shirone.Lumina watched Altor anxiously.As expected, his face showed his miserable feelings.
Nevertheless, the reason why she doesn’t get angry is because she’s just like Lumina.She had been watching Shirone since she was a child, and she knew.Shirone has not changed a bit.He used to be a good boy who thinks of others first.
“Stop it!Guys, you know, just look at a gold coin and feel it’s tight!When will you grow up?Let’s stop talking about something else.”
Lumina nagged the children back to their seats.Shirone thanked her.
Martin, who is quick to sense, changed the subject.
“By the way, did you hear that?”I heard that he appeared in the mountains behind him yesterday.”
“Oh, I heard that, too.At this rate, there will be no more wild animals left.How long are you going to eat it?”
“It must be Cowbear with a baby in it said.He has a great appetite.”
The cowbear is the largest gray bear in the bear family.In particular, it was a troublesome animal for hunters because females usually eat twice as much as predators when they have babies.
Shirone also showed interest in hunting because he had been hunting quite a bit.
“Did the cowbear come this far?”Doesn’t it live in the back of the mountain range?You must be in a lot of trouble.”
“Don’t mention it. My father is a hunter, but he’s a fool to meet these days.I can’t do it because the wild beasts are dying.”
“Then we’ll all get together and catch him, won’t we?”Cowbears are not particularly violent, so five people should be enough.”
“It’s logging season these days, so there’s not enough people.They’re all going to blame, and nobody’s helping them.Still, if you look at the mobile radius, you won’t have a baby here.I’ll be back to normal in about a week.”
“I see. You must be having a hard time, too.”
Altor flicked his finger with his eyes shining.
“Hey, Brad.Why don’t we catch that cowbear?”
“What? Us?”Isn’t it dangerous?”
“How can you look at me and say that?”I’ve hunted red bears known for their violence.It’s nothing like a cowbear.”
Altor intended to regain his tarnished reputation by this hunt.It was his strength and hunting skills that allowed him to gain an upper hand over Shirone, and in a way, it was an opportunity given by God.
“Hey, how are you?”Let’s all help Brad.”
“Well, I’d appreciate it if you could,”
If they can’t get their prey, their families will have to starve.The children who knew the fact could not resist Brad’s situation.Besides, if it were Altor, he would have caught the red bear, which is the smallest but most cruel.
“Well, then, let’s go and catch the Cowbear tomorrow!”
“Wow! Blood is boiling!”Brad, don’t worry!I’ll put an arrow in the bear’s forehead for sure enough!
“TWIT! Would it be you?”We can leave it to the trap and to the Althor.”
“I’m leaving tomorrow morning!You’re coming, aren’t you?”
asked Altor, with his sparkling eyes.In order to regain the position of leader, Shirone had to follow.Knowing the fact, Shirone nodded, thinking that it was better.
“All right. I’ve learned something from my father, so I can do my part of it.”
“Good! Cheers!”
The bubbling beer mug hit the air.
* * *
The next morning.
Shirone got up early in the morning to prepare for the hunt.
Specialized tools will be shared by children, but basic equipment must be equipped individually.
The rope was rolled up large so as not to twist, hung on the backpack, and checked the bow and arrow.
It brought cloth and glue to make torches, and also equipped with bamboo nails and hammers.
He put an extra arrowhead in his leather pocket and carefully packed dry food and whistle in case of distress.
When I lifted my backpack, the familiar weight made me feel good.
Shirone, the man, opened the door, thinking he was not dead yet, and all the children with the equipment gathered at the door.
“Hey, Shirone,”It’s too late.This fell out.(Laughs)
Shirone smiled awkwardly.As expected, the people in the field looked different no matter what.
“Haha, I’m sorry.I haven’t done it in a long time, so I’m not used to it
“Anyway, let’s go.for I have to come back before sunset.”
Altor took the lead and Shirone followed in the middle group with Lumina.Martin guarded the rear.
The sun rose when I reached the Cowbear-infested area.
Lumina started the fire and started cooking.Breakfast was corn soup and bread with melted lamb milk cheese.Shirone dipped the hard bread in the soup and swallowed it.
“It’s delicious. You have to understand Lumina’s cooking skills.”
“Hehe.”
Lumina smiled shyly.The children have certainly changed a lot, considering that they would have made a fuss about paying for their meals.But it was a good change, and Shirone was relieved that his friends were doing well.
“If you’re done, let’s get going.I think he’s up there.”
Altor took the children to the middle of the mountain.As if his prediction was right, bears marked their territory on each tree.Martin said, pointing to a tree with severe claw marks.
“Look at this,”The tree is completely dented.You must be very strong.”
Althor approached and examined the toenails carefully.
“Well, that’s no problem.I don’t think your feet are that big.”
“Isn’t it dangerous?”
“The bear has a reputation for its power.It’s faster than I thought.But Cowbears are slow to move.I can hunt enough people like this.”
Shirone belatedly examined the toenail marks.Then he frowned softly in a sense of discomfort.It was only a scar carved on a tree, but I couldn’t imagine a bear marking its territory there.
“It’s strange. I don’t think I did it by force.Rather, something very quick and sharp seemed to hit…….’
At this point Altor took out his bow.He leaned his upper body with his arrow loaded, and looked back and said,
“Anyway, I think we should start here, so be careful.Let’s go up a little further and set up a trap.”
The children who followed Altor climbed the mountain, stalling.Perhaps because this kind of life was a daily routine, everyone was skillful.
Shirone entered the Spirit Zone and sensed everywhere.A 40-meter diameter is not as good as a skilled hunter’s view, but there was nothing wrong with being careful as long as you felt bad.
As we reached the summit, a fairly unpleasant energy was transmitted through the synesthesia.As Shirone stopped and tried to grasp the true nature of the feeling, Altor turned around and asked,
“What are you doing, Shirone?”I’m not going to set up a trap here.”
“Althor. Something’s a little off.”
“What’s wrong with you?”I can’t feel anything.”
Altor blocked Shirone’s opinion in advance.No matter how smart Shirone was, he thought he was an expert in hunting.But Shirone remained unyielding and left the heat and walked somewhere.Altor followed with an angry look.Altruistic behavior in the mountains could have put everyone in danger.
“Shirone. If you’re going to keep doing this, just get off……Ugh!
Altor was frightened at the sight ahead.At this moment Shirone was speechless.As vomiting flooded in, the smell of the sheep’s milk cheese that I ate earlier flowed back.
“What is this…?”

Chapter - 71 - From the Top(5) 11.txt
===============================
[71] At the top (5)
The wild beasts were horribly torn and hung from tree branches like laundry. Among the dogs, ferocious carnivores were also seen.
The children who arrived late covered their mouths. By not screaming, they had done enough for the living.
“Ah, Alto. What happened? Is this really what Cowbear did?”
Martin’s voice trembled, and Rumina turned her head away and closed her eyes tightly, as if she couldn’t bear to see. Shirone made a decision faster than anyone else.
“Let’s go down. I don’t think this is a problem for us to solve.”
“No, let’s go a little further. I need to know what it is.”
“Altor! This is a serious matter!”
“So let’s go! If something like this enters the mountain, all the prey will leave! Then we will starve to death!”
“I know that, but it’s too dangerous. Let’s go down to the city and report it.”
“Declaration? Didn’t you go crazy after playing with the nobles? Who do you think cares about the situation of the buyer?”
“You fool, that’s what I’m talking about! It’s not such a trivial incident that I don’t care. look at the beasts over there Can’t you see how dangerous the situation we are in right now?”
Martin interrupted.
“Sir, Shirone. Alto. Look over there.”
The bushes were shaking with a rustling sound. Shirone and Alto loaded their arrows at the same time and aimed in the direction of the sound.
Booths. Booths.
The shaking of the leaves heightened the tension. The children also took out their weapons and waited for the mysterious identity to appear. When the slaughterer of the beast finally appeared, Syrone and Artor’s arrows rose far above their original target.
“Oh, this can’t be… … .”
The voice of Altor, who was defeated by no one in terms of bravery, was engulfed in fear.
“Krrrr.”
A wolf-like monster over two meters tall was glaring at the children with a stooped posture. Her chest muscles swelled like balloons and her waist was thin. Its arms stretched to its knees, and its clawed claws were as long as a human little finger. His knees were bent with reverse joints, but he looked agile as he supported his body with long soles like a cat.
Martin managed to squeeze his voice out.
“Mo, it’s a monster.”
Evolutionists hold the view that humans and other animals are derived from a single source organism. However, monsters were phylogenetically originating from completely different organisms. Therefore, it is not possible to completely analyze monsters based only on their animal characteristics. They were stronger and more agile than other animals, and even possessed intelligence.
‘Bipedal in the appearance of a wolf. It’s crying.’
Shirone recalled the knowledge she had learned from the book. Instead of having poor language skills, Ulrk can express hundreds of emotions through sound, and is social enough to live in a tribal life.
Because it is a balanced type with strong claws, quick mobility, and strong muscle strength, it was one of the monsters that even monster hunters were reluctant to fight when forming a group.
‘But why did you appear here? I know there are no monsters in this area.’
There was only one case that immediately came to mind. The Ulks who were defeated in the war between the tribes moved their residence and flowed here. As if to prove Shirone’s thoughts, Ulc’s body had scars here and there. It was impossible to guess how much blood had been shed as the blood of numerous animals was entangled in its fur.
The sound of the children’s rough breathing awakened Alto’s sense of responsibility. As a leader, he had to somehow get out of the situation.
‘Anyway, it’s a living creature. If it hits the mark, it’s an instant death.’
Alto took a deep breath and aimed the arrow. Even though he knew they were targeting him, Ulch calmly watched his prey with his hand on a tree. It was proof of reason.
‘die! You dirty bastard!’
Alto’s arrow flew like the wind. However, Ulc only slightly twisted his head and easily dodged it. Then he made the sound of scratching his uvula mockingly.
“Krr. Krrrr.”
The children were astonished at the dynamic vision of avoiding arrows at close range. But that was when the despair began.
Kwaji Jijik!
Ulc broke the trunk of the tree with only his grip. And he shouted at Ulthor.
“Aaaaaang!”
“damn! Run away!”
The moment he saw the brute strength of ripping off the log, Alto had no desire to reload his arrow.
Everyone ran towards the top, but Shirone stayed until the end and shot an arrow at Ulc.
“Aaaaaang!”
Shirone’s provocation angered Ulk even more. However, thanks to this, the children were able to buy time to escape.
Urlk jumped up with a nimble motion and slammed the top of Shirone’s head with his fingernail. At the same time, Shirone’s body turned into a flash of light and soared into the air.
“Kreung?”
Shirone, who was floating in the air due to teleportation, looked down at Ulc from a high place. Because it was deep in the mountains, it was difficult to continuously cast teleportation.
‘Not here. I have to go to the top.’
Alto supported the struggling children and ran and ran. He was right not to choose the downhill road. Under these conditions, he would all roll down as he descended.
“hurry! Run fast!”
The children who had thrown away everything, including their armory and luggage, climbed the mountain as if crawling, sticking out their tongues. Rumina shouted.
“What about Shirone? I can’t see Shirone!”
“You are buying time! Come up!”
Alto urged the children. I was worried about Shirone, but in the current situation, worrying didn’t help anything. First of all, I had to protect even the children.
“Aaaaaang!”
The moment the children reached the top, Ulck’s screams came from the downhill. Alto’s brow wrinkled. The fact that the monster came all the way means that Shirone ran away or died.
“damn! There is nowhere to hide!”
The top of the mountain was an empty field close to flat, and there was a cliff at the end. The height of the cliff was only 20 meters, but there was no time to climb down the wall.
“Altor! A monster is here!”
Urlk pulled the ground with his claws and climbed up. The stone-like muscles reflecting the sunlight were clearly visible. Altor, separated from the children, voluntarily became the bait.
“It’s here! This way!”
However, the cliffs were everywhere, so there was no place to escape. Alto turned back with a miserable heart. The muscles he trained every day were nothing but the strength of a child in front of monsters.
“shit! I do not know!”
When he raised his fist at the thought of dying, thinking that he would fight even if he died, Ulch disappeared in front of his eyes.
“Run quickly!”
Arthur looked around with a surprised expression. He was nowhere to be seen, but before he knew it, you and Shirone were lying around with Urlk.
“Uh, how?”
Altor tried to run to Shirone, but stopped when Shirone’s figure turned into light and disappeared.
“wow. Um, is that magic?”
Children who encountered teleportation for the first time were astonished. No matter how fast Ulc ran, when Shirone flashed the light, he missed the target in an instant.
“Aaaaaang!”
Unable to hold back his anger, Ulk cried out. However, the monster’s anger was not one-dimensional like the beast’s instinct. He thought that whoever he ate was the same meat, so he turned around and ran to where his children were.
“Aaaaaaa!”
The blue-eyed children scattered all over the place. Only the weak-minded Lumina was frozen, unable to even think of running away.
“Lumina! Run away!”
“ah… … . ah… … .”
Shirone held out her hand toward Ulc. And it combines photon-output battery and omnipotence. However, the place where Lumina was located was outside the radius of the Spirit Zone.
‘Oops! It doesn’t reach.’
Shirone converted the four-way method into a target type. As John changed into the form of a cross, the synesthesia finally caught Ulk.
‘Photon output!’
The light flashed and popped out and met Ulc’s eyes. Woolk covered his eyes at the sudden radiance and screamed.
“it’s okay! Shirone killed it!”
The impact of the beam was so great that the children thought that Ulck’s face would have been smashed. However, knowing that photon output has no physical force, Shirone shouted as she ran to Ulc.
“Lumina! run fast! I do not have time!”
Lumina hurriedly threw herself away. But her legs were already stiff and she just fell to the floor like a log. Realizing that Shirone’s magic was powerless, the children stomped their feet.
“What do we do? I guess it just shoots light.”
“Aaaaaang!”
Ulk, who had regained his sight, attacked Lumina. Her sharp hooked claws caught in her hair tie. Her rubber band snapped and her Lumina hair untied. At the same time, Shirone grabbed Ulc by the waist and cast teleportation. A flash of light shot into the sky and began to fall down the cliff from a high altitude.
“Shirone! no!”
“Aaaaaang!”
Every time Ulk tried to struggle, Shirone repeated the teleportation. Setting the direction of teleportation to the ground was a dangerous attempt that was strictly forbidden even at school, but she had no choice but to hold on to Ulc’s spirit.
‘What do we do? What should I do here?’
Even if he fell like this, Ulc wouldn’t die. Since there is no mass in the photonized state, the fall energy is 0 at the point where the momentary movement ends. However, when he gave up magic and fell, he had no ability to withstand Ulk’s struggle.
‘mass. Need mass… … !’
At that moment, goosebumps ran through Shirone’s body. It was a powerful portrait that I had never experienced before. Fragments of countless thoughts passed through my mind. beginning of the world. gauge symmetry. A whirlpool hovering over the bed. Mass is not force. The power of existence that unlocks the activities of the universe. A crack that breaks symmetry.
The cause of the sense of paranormal was the sense of deficiency felt when Shirone, which had expanded into the realm of infinity, was reconstructed into the human spirit.
The cacophony of omniscience and omnipotence.
The name of the lost fragment was Gravity.
When the omnipotence was established, the omnipotence that had been known through nightmares until now was precisely engaged. When the conditions for activating the magic were met, Shirone changed Ulck into a photonized state and threw him down.
“Big… … !”
Before the screams could end, Ulc’s body collided with the ground and bounced up with a loud sound.
Landing with a rainbow drop, Shirone glared at Ulc.
It was an instant death. The reason why I was shocked enough to break my bones in the photonized state was because the light was heavy.
“ha. ha.”
Matter is not born with mass. There is another element that imparts mass to matter and annihilates it.
An unknown particle that humans cannot observe.
That was the reason Shirone realized that the cell and gauge symmetry was broken in the realm of infinity.
“done. I finally figured it out.”
Shirone clenched her fists tightly. His heart trembled and his heart soared to the point of tears.
Aaaaaaaagh!
At that moment, the screams of children were heard from the top of the cliff. Shirone regained her cool and looked up.
“no way… … ?”
Come to think of it, Ulrk was a monster with social skills. Even if he lost a tribal war, he was unlikely to wander around alone.
“no!”
Shirone cast teleportation and flew over the cliff. When he reached the top, he stiffened up just like Al Thor and the others. Dozens of ulks surrounded the surroundings. The whole tribe was moving at once.
‘I underestimated their social skills.’
I heard children crying.
“Oh, what should I do? We are all dead now.”
“I couldn’t even get married. I don’t want to die like this.”
It was the same that Shirone did not want to die. And she now had the bare minimum weapons to fight Ulk.
“It’s okay, guys. I’ll try something.”
“What are you going to do? Don’t do that, you run away too. You can escape with magic.”
“are you okay. From now on, you’re not breaking the school rules.”
Shirone walked to Ulk’s group.
“Shirone! Dangerous!”
Alto called, but he turned away. He just glared at the Ulks, recalling his earlier realization.
The silver-haired Urlk, who seemed to be the chieftain, nodded in disapproval, and his right-hand man Ulc jumped out.
“Aaaaaang!”
Shirone focused the photons on her palm.
‘It’s not enough. more… … more… … .’
The light gathered in his hand gradually turned pale and finally emitted a blindingly intense white light. Meanwhile, Ulk was rapidly closing the distance from Shirone.
While measuring the distance to the enemy, Shirone focused on changing the nature of the photons gathered in her hand. As the screams of the children escalated, Ulk, who had finally arrived, swung his claws.
Shirone’s body was suddenly pushed back 1 meter. He widened his distance with short-range teleportation and cast magic with his eyes wide open.
‘Now!’
When he threw the condensed photons, a pale flash of light landed on Ulk’s abdomen. The photon, crushed in the form of a sphere, pushed Ulck away and stretched out again as a golden line.
“Aaaaaang!”
Ulk screamed and flew away. Then it collided with another ulk and rolled down the mountain.
The children’s eyes widened at the unbelievable reality.
“No, that is nonsense. did you just see That huge monster flew away dozens of meters.”
“How could that be? You mean that’s magic?”
After seeing Shirone’s magic, the chieftain of Ulk pulled his nose. It must have been remarkably intelligent that human language leaked out.
“mind… … law… … buy… … .”
Numerous eyes of Ulc stared at Shirone. But Shirone was only glaring at the chief.
I thought I could win.
The mass contained in the photon is minute, but the impact of the weight of the speed that extends at the speed of sub-light was at a level that broke expectations.
Also, this is the magic of the unlocker that only Shirone can use in the world… … .
It was a photon cannon (photon cannon).

===============================
[72] Dream On(1)
Photon Cannon.
Although the mass contained in the photon is insignificant, the impact of the photon output at high speed was not the level that a single monster could withstand.
Chief Ulc’s eyes burned. Having fought countless battles with humans, he knew how dangerous wizards could be.
“it’s okay! I must have been scared! Shirone did it!”
cried Martin. But Arthur had a different idea. The opponent he was facing now was a monster, not a beast. They say they have reason, but their beastly nature was not something to belittle.
“It won’t end like this. Even though Shirone is strong, she is only human. Beasts that hunt in packs never retreat after taking damage from one or two.”
As Artor analyzed, Chief Ulc had no intention of backing down. The wizard’s ability is destructive, but the violence of the group was not frightened by only one person.
“Kreurreu, porridge… … female… … la… … .”
“Aaaaaang!”
Ulc’s roar shook the heavens and earth.
‘you can do it. If you wake up, you can win.’
Shirone teleported up and bombarded the ground with a photon cannon. Flashes of light struck like hail. Even if they were not hit by the Photon Cannon, the shockwaves generated from the ground hit the Ulks.
Even so, Ulk’s prestige did not diminish in the slightest. In the case of forming a group, it was a warlike race that even the ogre called the king of the forest could fold.
Irrespective of the damage done to their kind, the Ulks jumped up and swung their claws at Shirone. Shirone hurriedly landed on the ground. There were also seven of them waiting for an opportunity.
Shirone converted Spirit Zone into a four-way attack type. The moment the thorns of the Spirit Zone touched Ulk, multiple photon cannons were fired. A blindingly intense flash stretched out, and the Ulks hit by the photon bounced back to where they came from.
“Wow, that’s amazing… … Shirone.”
The children made a bewildered expression. To think that humans could fight dozens of ulks on equal footing. I thought that stories of heroic feats were a bluff in the world. However, seeing the battle of Shirone, he seemed to be able to believe any story as fact.
“haha.”
Shirone’s breathing became rough. The moment she cast the Photon Cannon multiple times, her consciousness seemed to be blown away. It was difficult to endure even with the mental strength to sustain the photon output for more than 10 minutes. This is because Photon Cannon is fusion magic that combines light and mass.
Wizards have one slot into which batteries can be installed. It is the same reason that humans cannot focus on two things at the same time. With the Servant Syndrome, Eruki can double, but except for such a special case, even the most high-ranking magician can only use one magic at a time.
Therefore, it was rare in the professional world for wizards who use a single attribute, pure magic, as their main specialty. Most combine two or even three attributes to maximize the effectiveness of a single enchantment.
Siena’s Ice Tornado, a combination of cold and wind, and Thaad’s Fire Sun, a combination of light and flame, were representative examples.
Fusion magic has the advantage of maximizing the efficiency of the moment, but it required a high level of mental strength. It was natural for Shirone to feel tired after casting such magic in succession.
‘It’s a big deal. I think there are only a few steps left. I don’t think I can defeat them all.’
Woolk is different from the thugs of the alley. A beast’s sense of smell reads the emotions of its prey like a ghost. If it shows any sign of fatigue, it will immediately try to tear it limb from limb.
In fact, even after losing a third of his people, Ulk’s chief was still showing hostility.
Realizing that Shirone was exhausted, Ulc’s secondary unit rushed in. It was a similar number to the 1st unit, but compared to when the mind was intact, the feeling itself was different.
Shirone hit the photon cannon with a sense of urgency. A mass of photons was buried in the stomach of Ulc, who was running in front of him.
“Kuaaaaa!”
The body of the giant was pushed out as it dragged the floor. However, unlike before, he didn’t fall down and kept his legs on the ground. Shirone was terrified. I can’t imagine that the power would have gone down this much.
Convinced, the Ulk chief ordered an all-out attack.
“Kang! kang! Kwang!”
The Ulks also sensed victory and rushed at it.
‘Now that it’s like this… … .’
The only thing left for Shirone was Immortal Function.
But can you stand it?
It’s on a different level from what I’ve cast photon output before. It was unknown what the aftermath would be if fusion magic, which consumes a lot of mental power, was cast in the infinite realm.
“Big!”
The moment she opened the Immortal Function, pressure rose in Shirone’s mind. He thought his head might explode.
“Aaaaaaa!”
Shirone made up her mind and opened her mind. There was a rush of great power along with the feeling of his ego loosening.
The moment the spirit zone was filled with light, it exploded violently. Golden fragments flew as the mass wave pushed the Ulks away.
Floating an orb of light in her palm, Shirone shot it forward with all her might. The entire area was devastated as the Photon Cannons spread out in a flash of white light. Without reducing the output, the ulks swung as if they were sweeping with a broom.
But I couldn’t keep this state forever. If infinity is an ocean, Shirone’s spirit is a stream. The immortal function is like a barrier between them. They drilled a hole and boiled seawater, but the barrier would collapse over time.
Since the amount of mental power that must be paid for depends on the magic, the wizard chooses the most effective magic for the price depending on the situation.
Magic that has a far superior effect compared to its price is called over power in the magic society. Representatively, there were time magic stop, invisibility magic, invisibility, alchemy magic injection, and healing magic Heal of Almighty.
Then what about the Photon Cannon?
Shirone thought it was close to over power.
Excellent attack speed, mixed use of single shots and continuous fire, and even the form of a wick beam were all necessary conditions for attack magic.
However, it is only said that the efficiency is higher than the price. Basically, the Photon Cannon was an expensive magic. If it was cast indiscriminately like now, a terrible situation could have occurred.
‘no more! I’ll die first!’
Shirone stopped casting Photon Cannon. The saturation time was only about 3 seconds, but dust rose from all sides, making it impossible to see an inch in front.
As a gust of wind swept away the dust, the children shuddered at the sight unfolding before them. The area swept by the Photon Cannon was devastated.
The Ulks were buried in the ground, and those who escaped were also trembling in fear, unable to mourn the death of their own people.
Shirone realized the power of the Photon Cannon. In the place where the flash passed, there was really nothing left.
Since the person who cast the magic was admiring, the position of the victim must have been devastating. Chief Ulc had no choice but to admit the reality with a frightened expression.
That mage can’t win.
“Kreur, we… … liver… … all. send… … different… … .”
Currently, Shirone is in a state of exhaustion to the extent that any magic is impossible. However, I persevered with strength in my legs until the end.
“Never come here again. If you come into this mountain one more time, it won’t end there.”
The Ulk chief conveyed his servile feelings in clumsy human language.
“not… … come. descent… … All magic… … buy.”
“good.”
When Shirone waved his hand, Chief Ulc left first. The other Ulks followed the chief into the forest without any regrets.
Only after the Ulks disappeared, Shirone, who was relieved of tension, stumbled and fell with her eyes closed.
“Shirone! Shirone!”
“Shh! Quiet. They might come back.”
When Alto warned, the children covered their mouths.
Alto looked at Shirone again. I laughed out loud at the sight of him sleeping soundly without knowing the world.
The children of the slash-and-burn village grew up with the passage of time, but Shirone seemed to be the same as he was when he was young.
‘They say wizards don’t age.’
At first, I thought it was the son of a common mountaineer. A child from where he was born. Shirone didn’t look at all like Mr. Vincent, and that’s why he looked down on him even more.
But it was an illusion. Could Shirone be the ugly duckling in a fairy tale?
A human being different from the mountain man from birth.
Alto held up Shirone. Compared to her physical strength, she was as light as a feather, but she didn’t feel proud.
I now knew that I could never lift the weight of intelligence contained in a light body.
“Let’s go down. The hunting game is over.”
* * *
“omg!”
Shirone woke up and jumped up.
It was someone’s house.
When I put my hand on the back of the sofa and looked around, I saw a cozy floor.
I could feel the warmth of the brazier burning on the bonfire and heard the sound of food being prepared in the broken kitchen.
“uh? Shirone is broken Rumina, Shirone wake up!”
Martin shouted, and a crackling noise came from the kitchen. After a while, Lumina peeked out from the other side of the wall, revealing her flushed face.
“Here?”
Shirone then remembered. It was Lumina’s house where she often stayed with her father when she was young.
Children came pouring down from upstairs. She was dressed the same as when she went hunting, as if she stayed by Shirone’s side without returning home.
“Shirone, are you okay?”
Alto asked anxiously. As soon as he got home, he inspected Shirone’s body, but found nothing unusual. However, since he was ignorant of magic, abnormal signs might occur.
Shirone ran several experiments to see if there was anything wrong with her head. His memory was intact, and his mind seemed fine.
“are you okay. I must have collapsed from exhaustion.”
“Whoa, that’s good. We knew you were wrong.”
Shirone felt quite sorry for making her worry unnecessarily. Of course, the children thought the exact opposite.
“After a long sleep, I feel refreshed. I think the fatigue is going away now.”
I took a long sleep at the dorm, but in fact, I was not very tired. But now I feel really good. It’s because her nasty sense of super inlay has disappeared.
I was confident that I would overcome. But when what was there disappeared, he was able to realize how hard he had been enduring all this time.
‘Armin was right. As soon as I mastered the Photon Cannon, my senses returned. I didn’t even have a nightmare.’
There was a growl in the stomach. It was the hunger I hadn’t felt in a long time. The savory smell wafting from the kitchen also helped stimulate hunger.
Shirone licked his lips and asked Lumina.
“But what are you making now?”
“Pork stew. My mother bought meat for me.”
Rumina’s mother came out of the kitchen with a ladle.
“Shirone, how are you? long time no see.”
“Hello, Auntie. I’m sorry for nothing because of me.”
“Huh, I’m sorry if you say that. How long has my daughter waited for you?”
Rumina’s face turned red. But she suddenly turned sad in her eyes and lowered her head.
Alto understood her feelings. She must have noticed as well as her children.
Shirone cannot be our leader. He was not a child of a slash-and-burn village, nor was he the son of a mountaineer.
Shirone was a wizard.
As the atmosphere calmed down, Altor shouted in a hearty voice.
“now! hungry. Let’s eat some rice.”
“Wow! I will eat meat after a long time! go! energy! go! energy!”
Lumina’s mother placed a large barrel on the table. She said the stew with pork was swaying beyond the proper line.
There are only four people in Lumina’s family, but in the slash-and-burn village, they often eat together in one house, so there was enough tableware.

[73] Dream On(2)
When about 10 children sat down at the table, Lumina’s mother served generous portions of boiled meat.
Shirone noticed. It would cost quite a bit to prepare this much food. Paying the price wasn’t a problem, but it was odd on its own.
Alto said he had read Shirone’s mind.
“don’t worry. Selling monster skins makes money. Going to start working tomorrow. Of course, I will have to ask for your permission first.”
“huh? no. Of course it should. Oh, and the name of the monster is Ulk. I heard that fingernails and fangs can get you a pretty good price.”
I thought that if it was Shirone, of course he would allow it. Moreover, it was a bigger income than expected because other parts also made money.
But most of all, it was the fact that I learned the name of the monster.
In this world, knowledge also becomes money.
If you put it on the market without even knowing its name, it was obvious that you would use a dumping machine. It could have been a much bigger loss than the effort put into tanning.
“Right. Anyway, thank you. Like Ulck, without you, our village would have had to move to another place.”
For generations of people who have lived by cultivating fields and selling things from the mountains, it was a terrible thing to lose their home. In that sense, Shirone was a hero who saved the village.
“are you okay. Because this place is precious to me too.”
Shirone sincerely thought so. Ulk’s meat would decay over time and be unsellable, but the children did not go up to the mountain and remained.
not rich That’s why life is hard, so there are more things to blush than nobles, but I liked those who knew how to live together.
said Martin, munching on the meat.
“Anyway, I’m sorry that your hard-earned vacation ended like this. Wouldn’t you rather go up the mountain together tomorrow? Let’s sell everything, including the shells and nails, and have fun with the money.”
When it came to playing, the children of the slash-and-burn village were not missing, but Shirone shook her head in regret. He wanted to go back as soon as possible to analyze his insights.
“no. I’ve had enough rest. Thanks to that, my fatigue was relieved. I have to study hard now. I have to go back to school tomorrow morning.”
* * *
After dinner, the children went back to their respective homes. It was a moonlit night, but they still had work to do. The equipment had to be serviced overnight and the carts had to be checked.
Shirone climbed the hill and looked down at the slash-and-burn village. Children were carrying torches from house to house, preparing for tomorrow’s work. A soft smile crept across his lips as they joked around and chatted happily.
“Shirone, you were here.”
“uh? Alto, how did you find it?”
“I thought it would just be here. What are you thinking? You don’t even know I’m coming.”
“Old thoughts. When I came with my father, we played a lot. We play hide and seek in the field over there.”
“It did. But you had a lot more time to read books by yourself. Of course it’s because of us.”
“no. It’s because I love books so much… … .”
Alto gave a good laugh.
“You don’t have to. If you don’t know, it makes no sense. Because children have longed for you since before. So there were many times when I was jealous too. Now that I think about it, I feel sorry for you more than one or two things.”
“No, I was weird. Maybe I was afraid to meet people. It was a confusing time.”
Unlike other children in the slash-and-burn village, Shirone was the pride of her parents as she never had an accident. However, in reality, since he encountered magic at the age of 12, it has been a series of endless agony and worries.
Alto nodded as if he had a guess. He was able to see and realize Shirone’s magic today.
The boy who thought he only read books without knowing the world was actually fighting more fiercely than anyone else.
“I’m sorry, Shirone.”
“Because it’s okay.”
“No, not that. I mean at a drinking party. I said something presumptuous. Everyone has something called a bowl. I made a mistake. Don’t take it to heart.”
Shirone remembered Alto’s stinging point last night. He wasn’t hurt. He also chose magic because it was a burden he had to carry on his own.
“I don’t think so. Actually, I’ve never thought about it until now. How blessed I am living. How lucky you are.”
“No, Shirone. you worked hard That’s why others help you too.”
“But the truth is the truth. What you said is my reality, and that’s why I have to embrace it for the rest of my life.”
Alto smiled bitterly. There was no one in the slash-and-burn village where he could criticize himself like others.
“It’s amazing, being a wizard.”
The mindset of wizards was incomprehensible. But that’s why the people of the world are in awe of them.
Shirone and Alto looked down at the slash-and-burn village. They didn’t say anything to each other, but their eyes were looking at the same place.
* * *
the next morning.
The adults started their daily routine at dawn, and only the children were left.
Shirone ate breakfast at Lumina’s house and left the house.
The children saw them off, but they too were carrying a lot of work tools to dismantle Ulrk.
In their lives, where there is no day off, Shirone realized how important the road she was walking was.
“Goodbye, Shirone. study hard Be sure to become a wizard.”
Alto asked for a handshake. Other children also flocked to Shirone to say goodbye.
“Shirone, are you coming to play again?”
“Next time you come, tell me more about the magic school.”
“haha! okay. I will come after the semester is over. You guys are doing well too.”
After saying goodbye to the children, Shirone looked back at Lumina. Even in her cheerful mood, her face was as dark as she was.
Shirone also had a vague idea of Lumina’s love affair. But what? Things between a man and a woman weren’t something you could think of with your head.
“Thanks to you, Lumina, I ate a lot of delicious food. Will you do it again?”
Lumina then smiled. She had a transcendent smile. She knew that what she wanted more of here was that she was greedy.
“of course! So come often. If you pretend not to know that you are a wizard, I will beat you.”
“okay. I will definitely come back.”
While going down the hill in the slash-and-burn village, Shirone suddenly looked back. And she shouted at the children who were still in place.
“All right! healthy!”
When Shirone turned around and walked away, Rumina lowered her head helplessly. What made her sadder than the fact that Shirone was leaving was the reality that she could no longer even like him.
“Hey, are you okay?”
Alto put his hand on Lumina’s shoulder and asked. Rumina couldn’t hold back and shed tears. Alto was upset for nothing. He had guessed his love for Shirone since he was young, but he didn’t know if it was this serious.
“Sheesh, if you feel so sad, at least try talking. What should I do to beat him up and bring him back?”
“no it’s okay. Shirone didn’t leave.”
Rumina wiped away the tears alternately with both hands and raised her head. Suddenly, a bright smile appeared on her lips.
“Shirone, you are heading towards your dream.”
Lumina prayed to the god of mountains and forests.
May there be a warm light on his way.
* * *
While going back to school, Shirone thought about the topic raised by the slash-and-burn village.
How far can I really go?
Being a guest of the Ogent family did not accomplish anything by studying with the students of the Magic School.
Learning from failure as a lesson and continuing to work hard did not apply to him as a commoner.
You have to explode your talent without rest. We must develop without hesitating for a moment.
She goes to school with the support of the Ogent family, and studies the advanced science of magic at the expense of her parents.
Is this really the right way?
If you fail at least one chance, will you be able to accept it and live the world as before?
After arriving at school, Shirone turned to the research club. His mind was disturbed, and he was reluctant to enter the inn.
‘Are the kids having fun? I shouldn’t have lost much… … .’
By now, Eruki and Nade would be happily betting in a different world casino. Please, I hope you don’t hang only house documents.
Passing through the Eastas labyrinth and entering the warehouse where the study group was located, Shirone stopped in front of the iron door. A human voice leaked through the crack in the door.
“what?”
When I opened the door, Eruki and Nade were sitting on the sofa and arguing. Eruki was excited like never before at how heated the discussion was.
“you idiot! A perpetual power engine is absolutely impossible!”
“Why are you so tight in the front and back? I’m not talking about infinite power, it’s the second kind of perpetual engine!”
“That violates the law of entropy!”
“Then what is this! What is this I made!”
Nade pointed to the wind-up wagon on the table. In fact, it was an iron box with wheels that would be ambiguous to call it a wagon.
“uh? excuse me… … .”
Nade looked back at Shirone. And she reaped, picked up the wind-up carriage, and waved it before her eyes.
“Shirone! you see and tell me because i made this Once you’ve wound the mainspring like this, put it down on the floor… … !”
The wagon moved in a circular motion. Even so, the mainspring that had been wound had not unwound.
Eruki raised his ax eye and pointed.
“Hey Shirone! Don’t be fooled. That’s a total scam!”
“What is the scam? You are tired of waiting for when to stop, so you are doing this with me right now!”
“You fool! Anyone can make anything that can be proven in 1-2 hours! The institution you created is just highly efficient! Even when I turned the spring, it was filthy tight!”
“What is it? It’s a miniature, so it has limits. If you make it bigger, you can increase the performance 100 times!”
“How big are you going to make it? as much as the sky? It would be much more efficient to feed the horse and lead it!”
“All you have to do is show the possibilities! Technology is supposed to move towards lightweighting over time!”
“Technology that is not supported by theory will eventually collapse!”
“What do you know about theory! If you make it and use it, it’s done!”
Both mathematicians and engineers made sense. Shirone blinked and listened to him, then looked at the carriage.
Seeing them heat up the useless wagon, it felt like all of a sudden, all the worries from a while ago were blown away.
‘ah… … I see.’
One day, that wind-up wagon will also be born with a decent name through the research of numerous scholars. And someone will create new knowledge through it again.
How arrogant to think that only I can do something. I didn’t come this far because I was great.
If my father hadn’t bought me the book, if I hadn’t joined the Ogent family, if I hadn’t had the teleportation test, if I hadn’t met Eruki and Nade… … .
There is no current Shirone.
A series of coincidences that occurred with a very small probability. All those events led Shirone to this place.
‘thank you. Thank you for letting me stay here.’
Shirone, who was immersed in her own emotions for a while, quickly regained her smile and asked her friends.
“By the way, what happened to the casino?”
Nade, who was rubbing foreheads with Eruki, turned his head with an unfair expression.
“How is it? It was all robbed and returned in one day. If only the last bet had been placed, we could have hit the jackpot.”
“That’s why I said it would be a spade. 57 percent chance.”
“Funny! I heard you and lost a lot! 57% is a piece of shit! How is that different from bokbulbok?”

“You should have kept pushing! Didn’t you know that the error decreases as the number of trials increases?”
“That needs bullets too! If you followed your strategy, you would have to walk all the way to the house documents!”
“look! That’s right! There is nothing in the world that can be consumed infinitely! Same goes for energy!”
“Why are you saying that all of a sudden!”
“Ahahaha!”
Shirone burst into laughter. Everyone who challenges toward their dreams is one. So success and failure are only secondary issues.
Even if the people of the world point fingers at it as useless, or ridicule it as an idealist who can’t support a family, isn’t mankind able to develop this far because someone is doing it in the end?
‘It’s okay even if it’s not me. I am… … It doesn’t matter if it becomes someone else’s fertilizer.’
Shirone didn’t worry any longer. He is grateful for all the luck that has allowed him to come true, and he just needs to keep moving towards his dreams.
Eruki asked curiously.
“Shirone, why are you splitting things like that? Did you eat anything weird?”
Shirone shook his head without answering. And he made a promise again and again and moved on.
“I’m back, boys.”
* * *
There are two days left before the suspension is lifted.
Nade and Eruki arrived at the 4th training ground early in the morning and were waiting for Shirone.
It was early, but it was summer, so the son-in-law was bright, and the two of them looked at the entrance, yawning.
said Nade, rubbing his sleepy face.
“Ah, what is it? Call me in the morning.”
“Didn’t you say you had something to show me?”
“What are you showing me all of a sudden? I am full of energy just by showing you so far.”
“well. It must have been tattooed on a pepper.”
“Puhahahaha!”
Imagining what Eruki said, Nade burst into laughter. Meanwhile, Shirone entered the training ground.
“Oh, he was already there. But why is Nade like that?”
“I don’t know. I guess it’s because I’m a pervert.”
“Puhahaha! Tattoo! tattoo there… … ! Fuhahaha!”
Anxious Shirone didn’t ask. It’s probably because the two of them were exchanging silly jokes and doing that.
“Anyway, let’s begin. Because I want to show you quickly.”
“What are you showing me? tattoo? Fuhahaha!”
Eruki said as if he was pathetic.
“stop. it’s not funny anymore Anyway, why did you call me here? What do you want to show me?”
“wait. I’ll try right away.”
After walking to the center of the training ground, Shirone held out her hand toward the rocky mountain.
“what? photon output? Did you increase the output?”
Shirone cast a photon cannon. A flash of white light quickly passed in front of Nade and Eruki’s eyes.
bang!
The rock exploded with a dull roar.
Nade and Eruki’s eyes, which had been dull until a moment ago, widened. The chin seemed to come down.
The spot where the light struck was wide and sunken. The two ran and looked for traces without saying who was first.
“What, what? is it magic Or real magic?”
“It’s strange. You’re shocked by the light. I know that photons cannot be fused. Shirone, what happened?”
Shirone said with a proud expression.
“A new weapon I learned this time. It’s not a photon output, it’s a photon cannon.”
“It’s a Photon Cannon. The meaning is plausible. What is the principle?”
“that is… … A bit long, so to speak.”
As Shirone spared his words, Nade came running quickly. And shook Shirone’s shoulder with her face as her sleep fled.
“Tell me quickly! how did you do it! To put physical force into light, this is absolutely impossible!”
Light and electricity are cousins, so Nade was clearly aware of what Shirone had done.
“I will tell you. therefore… … Would you like to go somewhere with me?”
* * *
Shirone and the others entered the restaurant in the noble district. While satisfying her hunger with seafood pasta, Shirone talked about how she mastered the Photon Cannon.
The vortex of dust on the bed, the situation in which Ulk was thrown down the cliff, and the principles of the Photon Cannon that he realized at that moment.
Even without mentioning Armin, the Photon Cannon was an idea unique to Shirone, so it was easy to explain.
Nade and Eruki listened intently, not knowing whether the pasta was going into their mouths or their noses.
After the hour-long explanation, Eruki, who was lost in thought, put down his fork and said,
“I heard about gauge symmetry from my father. The gist is this. Are you saying that there is a separate particle that carries mass? And you can handle that particle.”
Shirone realized anew what a great person Eruki’s father was. To teach his son about gauge symmetry and nothing else. As the head of the dragon, he seemed to be aware of all the cutting-edge theories established throughout the wizarding society.
said Nade.
“In a word, the result of the immortal function is mass. He mastered the Photon Cannon and lost his sense of portrait.”
“huh. Besides, I don’t even have nightmares anymore.”
Eruki and Nade were lost in thought. A particle that transfers mass to matter. Shirone’s realization was a great discovery.
In particular, the Photon Cannon was a magic unique to Shirone. Because no one is omnipotent. If you are not a person who has directly experienced the infinite realm, it is not possible to cast simply by mastering omniscience.
“Awesome, Shirone. This may be even greater than we imagine. If you patent it, it’s a discovery that you can sit on the money cushion right away!”
Numerous inventions that could be made with Shirone’s theory were already popping up in Nade’s mind.
“So I want to ask you something, can you go to the library with me?”
“huh? library?”
“The school library is under disciplinary action, so entry is prohibited. So I’m going to go to the aristocratic library. To research the Photon Cannon a bit more. But since I can’t go in, I want you guys to take me.”
“That doesn’t matter. It will help us too. But why can’t I go in alone?”
Commoners cannot enter the noble library. If the suspension is lifted, you can use the school library, but I realized something after going to the slash-and-burn village. Denying identity doesn’t change anything. At least I wanted to be honest with my friends.
“Actually, I am not an aristocrat.”
Nade, who was chewing on the pasta, opened his mouth blankly. Eruki was also staring at Shirone as if shocked.
“I am a commoner. I was abandoned in a stable when I was young, and now my parents raised me. My father is an ordinary mountaineer.”
Although he jumped into the world of magic late, I can’t imagine he was a commoner. In particular, the fact that she was abandoned by her biological parents did not match the wrinkled appearance of Shirone at all.
“Sorry. I haven’t said it until now. I will accept any criticism. But I didn’t want to lie anymore.”
Nade and Eruki looked at each other. They felt the same feelings for each other through their eyes.
Eruki turned to Shirone and spoke first.
“It is a shocking fact. But to be honest, I don’t feel anything special? Anyway, you are Shirone.”
“So do i. I wouldn’t know if I knew it from the beginning, but now that I’ve heard those words, nothing will change. The times we had together will not disappear.”
I thought my friends would understand, but it was just a personal expectation. When she was recognized by them, Shirone was touched by her heart.
Eruki lowered his head and giggled.
“So it was a special screening. The reason I learned magic late was because I wasn’t a noble. Well, talent isn’t something you’re born with, considering where you’re from. It’s really great.”
“thank you. for saying so.”
Nade waved his hand at Shirone’s thrilled appearance.
“Hey. It can’t be that serious. I think I’m rather fortunate To be friends with you without prejudice. If I had known in advance, I wouldn’t have even dreamed of the research presentation a few days ago.”
Eruki gave up his thoughts and stood up from the table. If he dragged out more time here, the atmosphere would only deteriorate.
“Okay, let’s go to the library. It was boring to play, but it worked. Let’s burn the passion for learning properly!”
Shirone and Nade stood up and shouted.
“Good!”
Return of the Archmage (1)
Basuka, the capital of Tormia Kingdom.
There was a dungeon 70 meters deep underground that was completed 100 years ago in the underground mountain range that flowed around the capital. Called the Labyrinth of Darkness, this place was once the hideout of the great wizard Viltor Arcane, who ruled the world.
Arcane, an authority on dark magic, fought with various nations until he suddenly disappeared 40 years ago due to an incident.
At the time, Arcane’s wizard level was an unofficial level 3.
Once you reach level 3 or higher, you will be given the title of Archmage regardless of public or non-official.
The wizard’s grade is determined by achievements and reputation, and the Magic Association manages this with a special scoring method.
The number of points required to advance from level 10 to level 9 is 1,000 points, including Achievements and Fame. And the number of points needed to go from level 4 to level 3 was 280 million points.
In other words, third-class wizards were those who had accumulated enormous achievements and reputations that ordinary people could not imagine.
Comparing 500 points for the achievement set for clearing the demon cave with a risk level of A grade and 100 points for the reputation set for meeting the king at the invitation of the royal castle, it was possible to guess how much Arcane was stirring the world.
Arcane rose to the position of an unofficial third-class wizard 40 years ago, at the age of 89. Looking at the score at the time, the part about his achievements was 100 million points, and the part about fame was 180 million points.
The reason his reputation is higher than his achievements is because he was a troublemaker who turned the continent upside down.
Banned experiments are the basics, and the bane of the era when the national foundation was shaken by accidents such as producing anarchists by association with dark organizations.
Elderly people over the age of 70 would shudder at the mere mention of Arcane’s name, so it was clear how high his notoriety was without even mentioning the 280 million points.
“Pooh. Pooh.”
Arcane opened her eyes in a crystal tube filled with green liquid. He was not wearing a single thread, and his skin was stretched like a 149-year-old body.
‘at las… … It’s finally completed, the essence of darkness.’
It was the dark power he had accumulated over 40 years. Arcane intended to absorb this and recreate its former glory.
The reason humans die as they age is because cells reach the limit of self-replication. However, Arcane was suppressing cell division through a bio-maintenance device.
Arcane glanced around and saw the crystal on the desk. At first, it was something that was shiny like a diamond, but now it has turned black. It was thanks to the accumulation of dark power in the crystal with injection magic once a day.
‘Alpheas, wait! I will definitely repay this disgrace.’
After being mortally wounded by Alpheas in his early 20s, Arcane’s magical power declined rapidly.
However, he survived with a single thought of revenge, and finally, today, he would regain his former power and become a great wizard once again.
As the green liquid from the life support system drained down the drain, Arcane’s back bent as the water level dropped. It was a senile body that could be put in a coffin right away.
As the front of the crystal ball was cut open, Arcane gasped for breath and crawled out.
“Canis! scale! Do you have anything!”
A young-looking boy and girl opened the door and entered. The atmosphere was somewhat gloomy, probably because he had learned dark magic.
“Did you call, Master?”
“clothes. Give me my clothes.”

[75] Return of the Archmage (2)
Canis brought me a light green robe. She was in front of Arin watching, but Arcane changed her clothes without hesitation.
Arcane, who moved while stepping on the table, was able to catch her breath only after sitting on the chair.
“Whoa, it looks like I’m going to live a little longer.”
“Are you okay, Master?”
Canis asked anxiously. The pale skin and contrasting dark circles made it known that he was a dark wizard without revealing it.
‘It’s a nice eye. That’s why I made him a disciple.’
On the other hand, Arcane did not like Arin very much. It is clear that he had a talent, seeing that he had black hair and dark eyes, but he had a weak mind and poor judgment.
There was no malice in the pretty face, and the emotions were clearly visible in the large eyes.
From the moment he saw the old man’s naked body, Arcane clicked his tongue at the sight of her trembling eyes.
‘Tsk tsk, how do you use something like that? It seems useless.’
If it hadn’t been for Canis’ best friend, he wouldn’t have brought such a weak girl.
It was that day 7 years ago.
Unable to move even with life support, he squeezed his last stamina into the capital Baska.
As befits the largest city in the Tormia Kingdom, the streets were rich and splendid. However, on the other side of the light, the miserable lives of those who were abandoned in the city continued.
Ghetto Radum.
As befits a highly polarized capital city, the residents of Radum were living a much more miserable life than the beggars in other cities.
The only way to get food in a place where people don’t even come is to rummage through garbage cans. Even then, the competition was fierce, and it was common to commit murder to eat fish bones.
Arcane found Canis and Arin there.
In Radum, where everyday life is war, the way Canis, who is only ten years old, survived with Arin was to be cruel.
Canis’s eyes were burning with hostility towards the world.
Arcane liked that look. Then he brought the two to the dungeon and taught them dark magic.
‘My eyes weren’t wrong. That must be a thing.’
Arcane refused Canis’ support and stood up. Since it was a day to escape from the dreaded aging, he didn’t want to appear weak today.
“Keep an eye on the greatness of the Dark Magic.”
Arcane held the black crystal and closed his eyes. Her hands trembled from her weakness, but her face was filled with excitement that could not be concealed.
“Big!”
As he cheered up, the crystal became soft and wrapped around Arcane like a stream of water. Then, like a dark cloud, it scattered and covered the whole body.
“Quaaaaaaaa!”
Arcane let out a monstrous scream. He absorbed the power he had accumulated for 40 years at once, so if he was an ordinary person, he would have already gone mad.
The concept of dark magic is absorption and assimilation.
Arcane regained his former power by assimilating the dark power absorbed into the crystal into his own darkness.
“Oohhh!”
The shadow cast under Arcane’s feet blazed like flames, then separated from the main body and scattered like fragments.
how much time has passed
Canis and Arin slowly opened their closed eyes. In Arcane’s appearance, I couldn’t find the slightest hint of old age.
It wasn’t that he looked younger or that his waist was straightened. However, her complexion was flushed and her eyes were full of vitality.
Sensing an unapproachable aura from her master who had regained her health, Canis trembled with emotion.
‘Is this the true face of Master? I’ve heard rumors, but it’s really amazing.’
Arcane smiled as if satisfied. It was as strong as it was before being defeated by Alpheas.
“let’s go. From today, the history of Arcane will be rewritten.”
Arcane, who had been waiting for this day for 40 years, left the dungeon without even having time to feel the afterglow of the rushing power.
* * *
The place where Arcane arrived was Baska’s western prison ‘Inferno’. As it is a place where serious criminals between Class D and Class B are imprisoned, he boasted impenetrable security.
“stop! Who are you! This is a controlled access area!”
The guards did not respond carelessly even to the elderly and children approaching. He first drew his weapon and shouted vigilantly.
“Reveal your identity! If you do not comply, I will arrest you!”
“The new blue kids… … .”
A shadow stretched from Arcane’s feet and merged with the shadows of the guards. Unaware of what had happened, the guards rolled their eyes and their eyelids trembled. Then he fell to his knees and fell to the floor.
“Hey, it’s not even a snack. Canis, open the door.”
Canis took a keychain from the guard’s waist and opened the front door of Inferno. He is a master who can crumple an iron gate if he wants to, but he doesn’t seem to have any intention of making things big.
However, Canis’ expectations were immediately missed. From the moment he broke through the main gate, Arcane began to reveal his true colors.
“It’s an intruder! attack! Killing is permitted!”
“Contact the castle and ask for support! A wizard!”
The guards came rushing in with weapons. But to the Dark Wizard, numbers didn’t matter. Arcane’s shadow extended like tentacles and merged with the soldiers’ shadows.
“Ouch! What’s this?”
“I can’t move!”
The guards couldn’t move their bodies. Then, when Arcane swung his hand, he turned to his comrades and began stabbing the spear against his will.
“Aww! it’s crazy? It’s dangerous!”
“I don’t know either! It’s not me!”
Arin’s face turned pale. Born with eyes completely different from those of others, she accepted the fears of the guards without filtering them.
“Canis, you never said Master would come to a place like this.”
Canis wondered as well. However, his trust in Arcane did not waver in the slightest.
“What are you thinking? Let’s go.”
Arcane slowly broke through the battlefield and headed for the building. When the shadows connected to the guards were suddenly cut off, those who were brawling collapsed with bubbles.
It was mind control, a characteristic of dark magic.
Darkness unites with other darkness. It is to use such characteristics to infiltrate the shadows of others and control their bodies and thoughts.
Looking at the advantages, the nature of dark magic itself was overpowered.
Nevertheless, the reason why it is considered non-mainstream is that one disadvantage covers all the advantages.
It was just that it was weak against light.
In a state where the sun is up, darkness can only exist as a span of shadow. In addition, the stronger the light, the more mental power must be consumed to cast dark magic.
Of course, at night, the dark mage’s capabilities are maximized, but even that was on the verge of losing its light as the photonization theory developed by a genius named Kergos became popular.
There were almost no students who majored in dark magic even in the continent’s magic schools, so it was possible to know how neglected dark magic was in the wizarding society.
However, Canis knew that Arcane had perfectly overcome the disadvantages of dark magic. And the strongest essence he realized was passed on to himself.
‘Yes, you must trust Master. The one who gave me everything.’
After breaking down the entrance and entering the prison, Arcane took care of additional guards in the hallway. Then, they opened the iron door of building A-3, where the prisoners were imprisoned, and entered. Sensing that the incident had already occurred, the prisoners pounded the bars with rice bowls.
“hey! I don’t know who it is, but take it out!”
“hey! Open this damn iron door! Cases are not enough! Or I could kill someone else instead!”
Arcane slowly held out both hands. The grim surroundings of the prison were the perfect place for Arcanes to show off their talents.
“The Power of Darkness.”
The shadows cast in the hallway changed into the shape of a hand and then came out three-dimensionally. Hundreds of hands gripped the barbed wire and yanked it, and the twisting sound of the iron could be heard. The moment the frightened prisoners retreated to the wall, the bars were ripped out in order along the corridor.
bang! bang! bang! bang! bang!
The Power of Darkness was a magic that used the shadows that absorbed the surrounding energy like limbs. A single shadow could only lift a pebble, but hundreds of pairs of hands could easily pull out even an iron bar.
The iron gate opened and after a while, the prisoners showed their bizarre appearance. A heavy iron ball was attached to his ankle.
“What are you, a wizard? It’s so crazy.”
“Anyway, thank you. Let’s say Tongseong. I am Crown, the night cat. On this floor, if you hear your name, they will recognize you.”
Arcane felt the pathetic energy of the prisoners and put on a displeased expression. Even 40 years ago, Inferno was not like this. How did a place that was full of all kinds of heinous criminals end up like this?
‘Time is so free. Does that mean that my life has improved?’
According to Arcane’s theory, the quality of criminals decreases as civilization develops. This is because there are more scammers who know how to roll their hair, and real bad guys infiltrate society.
“Poor things. Does the criminal introduce himself? Do you think you can get out of here just because the bars are gone?”
“What, is this old man senile? I tried to get over it as best I could, but do you know who I am?”
The prisoners stretched out, trusting their superiority in numbers. There is no guarantee that they are on the same side just because they went to prison together.
“Listen up, you fools. If you don’t have the confidence to defeat me, just stay in prison. If you disobey my order, you will suffer the pain of breaking your bones.”
The prisoners burst into laughter.
“Puhahaha! What are you talking about, old man? We’ve come this far, do you think we’ll go back smoothly?”
“Let’s step on it! I need to get out of this damn prison!”
In the excitement of regaining freedom, the prisoners rushed at them without hesitation. But they soon realized that their ankles were still shackled.
Was it paralyzed for a while? Maybe I wasn’t aware of it because I had been wearing it for years.
“uh? uh? Holy shit!”
The prisoners then began to panic. Arcane watched their chatter and snorted at him.
If you chose to be evil as an old man, you must have skills, and if you do not have skills, you must have good brains. However, they were just parasites who ate food in prison.
“The Power of Darkness.”
“Uh, ah! what’s this!”
The hands that had tore off the bars this time wrapped around the prisoners and dragged them into the darkness. Their eyes, noses, and mouths disappeared into a black veil as if they were buried in a giant gel.
After a while, the sound of bones breaking was heard.
“Ugh! Ugh!”
“Turn it off!”
The silenced prisoners could not even scream.
Arin, who heard the eerie sound, spoke to Canis with a shudder.
“Canis, do you really have to do this to get revenge?”
“Arin, denying Master is denying us.”
“Even though… … .”
“Have you forgotten what happened in Radum? There have been many worse things than this. Besides, the prisoners here are the same ones that plagued us in Radum.”
“But you promised. To forget everything that happened in Radum. I will be happy from now on.”
“Nothing is over yet. If Master’s grudge is not resolved, happiness will not come to us either.”
As the darkness that filled the corridors disappeared, prisoners with broken bones were lying on their backs in grotesque positions.
Arcane, who looked down at them with arrogant eyes, murmured.
“Frail things. Was it a worthless step? Or would you feel better if you go to another room?”
The number of criminals imprisoned in Inferno is 320. Perhaps it was only here that low-level people gathered.
