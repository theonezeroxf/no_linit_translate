[76] Return of the Archmage (3)
Iron Krung. Iron Krung.
As I was thinking about that, I heard the sound of chains from the prison cell at the end of the hallway. When a man resembling a wolf appeared, Arcane’s eyes lit up with interest.
My thoughts were different from those who jumped out without covering their fronts just because a barbed wire was opened. Besides, I liked that he was handcuffed in addition to the shackles.
“There is still one more left. Did you hide your presence? The schema is quite good.”
The man inspected the faces of the fallen prisoners and let out a dejected laugh.
“Heh heh heh, I’m stumped. do you know where this is? West prison called Inferno. Are you thinking of treason?”
“Treason. It’s fun. Will you join us?”
The man shrugged.
“There’s nothing I can’t do if you let me go.”
“Even if you couldn’t see, your ears would have been open. There is no freedom unless you defeat me.”
“Haa, that’s tight.”
The man raised his handcuffed arms and scratched his head. The instant the eyes shining through his forearms shone sharply, he threw himself away without even warning.
When he swung his foot with the leaping power of the schema that surpassed even the weight of the iron ball, the iron ball was thrust right into Arcane’s face.
“Master!”
pop!
The man bent his knees and landed with a tired expression. He hit a person and this sound came out.
“Sheesh, that’s annoying magic.”
Arcane didn’t budge. The half of the face hit by the iron ball was covered with a black shadow. It was dark skin magic that absorbed shock by maximizing the absorption power of dark magic.
“It’s quite usable. You pass.”
As Arcane cast the power of darkness, a shadow rose from the floor and grabbed the man’s shackles and handcuffs.
“Don’t move. Your limbs might fly off.”
Before the man could reply, the shadow rose like a blade and spun rapidly. The chain broke in an instant, and the man’s skin was not damaged in the slightest. The limitless molding technique and delicate manipulation were the essence of dark magic.
“It would be nice to be free. follow me I have work for you to do.”
“Why are you doing this? Didn’t you ever say you’d join?”
The corners of the smiling man’s lips trembled.
You already know how strong your opponent is. But wouldn’t it be meaningless to have escaped if you were led like a cow?
“Money is what drives you. If you help me, you can touch a lot of money.”
It is common knowledge among common sense that wizards are rich.
Besides, men were also human beings who would do anything to make money, so there was no reason to refuse.
“Whoops, that’s a lot of money. If it’s an in-between amount, I’ll quit halfway.”
The man followed Arcane and left the prison. That’s how one prisoner escaped from Inferno.

Shirone and the others rented an inn after organizing the materials they had collected at the library in a notebook. After two days of discussion, we were able to outline the principles of the Photon Cannon.
“Why does mass exist?”
If there is no mass, nothing changes. And it was a good world in its own way. Isn’t it a big deal just because today is the same as yesterday?
But in the beginning there was mass. As if this world should be filled with some new things.
“Mass is not weight. Weight is a force that acts in the direction of gravity. There is no direction in space. So what is mass? cohesion? But I don’t think even that is a complete explanation.”
Nade asked.
“Then what do you think?”
The feeling in my head was clear. It was clear, but not clear.
“Existence.”
“huh?”
“Proof that you are in this space. Isn’t that what mass is?”
Life is the code of life only. Perhaps mass is the true proof of existence that is used throughout the universe.
“Hmm. I hear it and it seems so. Like the will or breath of the Creator, for example.”
Upon hearing Nade’s words, Eruki snapped her fingers.
“God Particles.”
“huh? what?”
“God Particles. isn’t it okay The particles Shirone discovered are called God Particles.”
“Oh, are you okay? Shirone, what do you think?”
Shirone always nodded. It was as if he had excavated something original rather than a word created by Yiruki, and he felt like it fit exactly into the omniscience he was feeling.
“I like it very much. And it matters.”
“that’s right. Because the wizard’s omnipotence is linked to feelings. It is better to use a name that you like.”
In that sense, God Particles was an excellent choice.
When the discussion was over, Eruki lay down on the bed. His eyeballs were about to fall out from digging through books all day.
“Whoa, let’s finish the analysis with this and go back to school tomorrow. Classes will start normally from the day after tomorrow, so let’s prepare our minds. Surely you haven’t forgotten your promise already?”
Nade chimed in.
“of course. Going up to Class Four this semester. From now on, I will study like crazy. In the worst-case scenario, Shirone could graduate first.”
Maybe.
At first, it was said as a joke, but Nade and Eruki’s faces became more and more serious.
At this rate, Shirone might graduate first. To that extent, the discovery of God Particles was a great achievement.
“Shirone, do you have any plans to attend one more year after graduation?”
“haha! What are you talking about? In the current situation, I am the one with the greatest chance of not keeping my promise. At least you guys are at the top.”
Shirone’s words were not wrong, but considering the growth rate alone, it was enough to make her feel a sense of crisis. It was a situation where a student who did not even know how to live was assuming graduation in half a year.
“I can’t sleep. I’ll study and sleep.”
“uh? That, then me too!”
When Eruki got up from bed and opened the book, Nade took a seat at a table in the corner and began to study.
Even if the end comes tomorrow, Shirone was dumbfounded when the friends who wanted to play and see each other burned their passion for learning. However, he looked at them with warm eyes.
‘I met some good friends.’
Shirone was the last of the three to open the book.

Kingdom Education Academic Society Teachers’ Society.
The Kingdom Academic Conference, hosted by the Teachers’ Association, was a place where social and cultural workers, such as magic schools, swordsmanship schools, monks of each denomination, schools, alchemy foundations, and the 99 elite artists gathered to present a vision of the kingdom.
Thaad attended the academic conference as the representative of Alpheas Magic School. He was on the verge of losing his mind in a situation where discussions on the harmful effects and positive functions of injecting education continued for several days.
‘Oh, damn it. Don’t they even sleep? Let’s go home.’
I attended because I was caught in the lottery, but I really hated it. He was a bully from his school days, and he was self-willed and nabal, and he was careful that he had nothing to do with education.
The fact that there were many good female teachers was the only consolation. In particular, the woman sitting at the round table across from him was the perfect ideal type.
Everything was attractive, from the flowing blue hair to the playfulness that could not be hidden even in a suit.
‘It looks good. Did I say Ogent Reina?’
He was a member of the 99 members, the best group of artists in the kingdom, and was a musician who attended as a disciple of melodious pianist Merhen.
The discussion ended at 7pm.
When an evening party hosted by the Teachers’ Association was held, the enthusiasm for discussion disappeared like a lie. The attendees were busy sipping wine and interacting with people from various fields.
In particular, there were high-ranking figures around Reina that even those who were not interested in the Teachers’ Association would have heard of.
‘I guess the phrase ‘beauty is painful’ is used in times like this.’
Thaad overheard their conversation as he waited for his turn to speak. Most of them were cringingly authoritative words or jokes.
Reina responded kindly without losing her kind smile. She was an unexpected figure to Thaad. It was because she had a bright personality that did not match the notoriety of the 99 members.
Art is a technique to deal with emotions, so the power to dominate the public was not at a level that even those in power could ignore.
In particular, due to the nature of the critical function of art, there were quite a few stubborn people among artists.
However, Reina was happily hanging out with people from all walks of life as if she had nothing to do with those rumors.
‘Haa, it would have been nice if Siena-sensei had only half of that personality.’
As I was sipping wine while thinking about that, Reina, who had finished the conversation, walked towards Thaad.
“Hello, Mr. Thaad.”
“Ah yes! what? But do you know me?”
“sure. You are a teacher at Alpheas Magic School. Ogent’s home is in Creas.”
“aha! Yes. I was blinking Nice to meet you.”
The two of them talked for a long time in the joy of the trend. As Thaad predicted, Reina had a bright and fun personality.
“By the way, is Shirone doing well?”
“yes? How does Reina-san make Shirone? Oh, I see.”
Thaad, who was the teacher for grading the entrance exam in Shirone, recalled that the Ogent family was written where he was from.
“Shirone was a guest of the Ogent family. As expected, you have an excellent eye for people. Shirone is doing well. Well, although she had an accident recently.”
“yes? Are you buying? What kind of accident?”
When Raina opened her eyes wide, Thaad felt sorry for her. Her pride would crumple when she found out that the Ogent family’s pushy student had been suspended.
“Ahaha! No big deal. Since he is an outstanding student, even the smallest things are widely known. It’s an accident in that sense.”
“Aha, that was it.”
Reina let out a sigh of relief. Even after hearing Thaad’s story, she could guess what kind of life Shirone was living.
“I’m glad you’re doing well. Do you have many friends?”
“Sure. It is popular with both men and women. Sometimes I’m too envious. ha ha ha!”
“Hoo. Then maybe… … .”
Reina, who was about to ask if she had a boyfriend, shook her head. As her supporter, it’s a question she can do enough. But the questioner in her mind was not only borrowing the name of her benefactor.
“yes? Any questions?”
“no. I’m glad you seem to be doing well.”
“haha! Do not worry. It’s hard to say this with my own mouth, but Alpheas Magic School is prestigious. You can leave it with peace of mind.”
“Huh, that’s right. I’m off topic. sorry.”
“no. Rather, I was c*cky. How about going to Creas with me? I’m planning to leave in the morning. I will treat you to a nice lunch.”
Reina shook her head with a sad expression.
“sorry. I think I will have to go back to Baska because the performance is scheduled.”
“Oh, I see. this… … .”
Thaad could not hide its regret. As usual, she would have let go without regret, but she was truly a woman to be missed.
“I can’t help it. But I really want to see the performance. Would you mind giving us your schedule? I will go to Baska.”
“Oh my, this is an honor. Actually, I was worried. I was wondering what to do if there are many vacancies because bad things happen in the capital.”
“Oh, what happened to Baska?”
“They say that a dark mage raided Inferno and escaped a Class B wanted man. Right now, the capital is in a state of security that is comparable to martial law.”
“dark… … Are you a wizard?”
Thaad’s brow wrinkled. It may be one of many news, but if you think about it, it was a rare event.
Dark wizards are hard to find in the world these days. Besides, did you have to attack Inferno? And that’s just to get one Class B wanted out?
Dark Mage, Inferno, B-Class Wanted.
A scene from history passed through Thaad’s mind.

“Could you give me a little more detail?”
“The incident happened a week ago. The escaped prisoner is a man named Lucas, and he was the vice-captain of the parrot thieves before he was captured. The leader is currently wanted.”
“Don’t you know the impression of the person who attacked Inferno other than the escaped prisoner?”
“Um, well. I’ve only heard rumors. I heard that you are an old man with gray hair. It seems that there were 2 seeds. They say he got the prisoners out with dark magic. What was that, I think it was something of darkness… … .”
“A power of darkness?”
“yes that’s right! After all, you are a magic school teacher.”
Reina raised her voice, but Thaad did not listen. dark magic. Inferno was also attacked by an old man who casts the Power of Darkness, an advanced technology.
‘no way?’
Sad shook his head.
“sorry. Let’s go first.”
“yes? Ah yes.”
Being polite until the end was close to instinct. In Thaad’s eyes, neither the party nor the beautiful woman were visible anymore.
‘Damn it! Of course, when I’m on a business trip!’
He said the jailbreak was a week ago. It would have been enough time to reach Creas if he had moved from Baska without stopping.
“carriage! carriage!”
After leaving the mansion, Thaad got on any carriage waiting in line. Then she opened the window of the driver’s seat and shouted.
“Until Creas! ASAP!”
“Cows, guests, and carriages here are all reserved. If you are not on the list, you cannot attend… … .”
Since it was a carriage for a high-ranking official, he couldn’t change his mind with a decent amount of money.
Thaad searched his pockets and took out all the money he had.
“ruler! take it Are you going to go or not?”
The coachman, who counted the number of gold coins scattered on the box seat, immediately corrected his expression and prepared to set off.
“I will see you soon. Are you passing the night?”
“I need neither sleep nor rest! Please go quickly!”
The cheerful sound of horses hooves pounded the night air.
“shit! I shouldn’t be late.”
Thaad leaned back against the backrest and touched his forehead. I wanted to leap by moving space, but I didn’t have enough lives even if I had to cast it in a row in a foreign place where I didn’t know the coordinates or the environment.
The fact that I couldn’t do anything made me regain my composure. As the situation was understood, this time I had a question.
With what intention did he reappear in the world?
Thaad has never met him or seen his face. However, the terrible bond he heard from Alfeas was vivid in his memory.
“Viltor Arcane… … .”
Thaad’s eyes stared straight ahead, burning.
* * *
It was past 4:00 in the morning, and Canis and the others entered the training ground halfway up the mountain at Alpheas Magic School.
I had never attended a magic school, but I could see that it was a top-notch facility as a disciple of an archmage.
A frivolous voice broke the silence.
“Whee, you built it well. You’ve been plastered with gold coins. How much are you going to pay for the land?”
Canis frowned and turned his head. Lucas, a Class B wanted man, had a pair of parrot-engraved swords slung over her shoulders.
“Keep your voice down. The guards might be patrolling.”
“What are you worried about? You can’t cut it off. You can bury it.”
Canis felt even worse. He was a human being who accompanied Master according to his will, but did not have a single favorite corner.
“Aren’t you mistaken? you are hired by us If there is a setback in the operation, I will not leave you alone.”
“Whoa, be scared. Kids these days are good. I meet a great teacher and talk badly to adults.”
Lucas slumps down on the training ground. Canis suppressed his anger as he did not interfere with the operation any longer.
‘The most important thing is Master’s revenge. Even if I don’t like it, I have no choice but to endure it.’
Lucas asked, yawning.
“Why are we waiting here anyway? You have to go down to school anyway.”
Arin expressed his disgust and said.
“Master will cast a spell. Because it’s wide-area magic, we won’t be safe if we get in range. He can go down first if he’s confident, but hey.”
Lucas shrugged. He was honest about wanting to avoid arcane magic.
“Hehe, don’t be too angry, little girl. Your cute face looks ugly.”
“Heh, it doesn’t matter how you look or not.”
“Shouldn’t you be dating my uncle? I can teach you something more fun than magic.”
Canis cut off the conversation just as Arin, who was blushing, couldn’t stand it and was about to shout.
“quiet. This is the beginning.”
Canis and the others’ gaze turned to the sky. Arcane was floating in the center of the moon with fly magic cast.
Fly is a fusion magic that uses two types of air, press and blow, at the same time. First, press-type magic creates solid air pressure around it, and then blow-type magic generates wind to generate lift. Thanks to the merit of flying, it is classified as overpowered, but since the wind changes in real time, a delicate sense was essential.
As the darkness came and covered the moon, Arcane’s concentrated eyes opened. Combining omniscience and omnipotence, he spread his limbs and cast Abyss Nova, the masterpiece of his life.
There were no roars and no terrifying aftershocks, but the sight of darkness covering the school was spectacular.
When the effect of Abyss Nova spread to the outskirts of the magic school disappeared, the moon appeared again and the son-in-law became brighter.
“Whoa. Whoa.”
Arcane let out a heavy breath. It was a gigantic magic that required 90% of his mental power to be consumed even by the great wizard.
‘It must be difficult to raise for the time being.’
Arcane turned and headed for the mountain. He had a hard time even maintaining his fly magic, but his rage grew stronger.
As long as Abyss Nova spreads, there is no one to disturb him. Besides, didn’t he raise disciples in preparation for such a situation?
“Cheuk, wait, Alfeas. I will let you taste the humiliation of 40 years ago.”
The dark night passed, and a faint light was rising from the eastern foot of the mountain.
Dark Intruder (1)
It was the last day of suspension. After studying until dawn at the inn, Shirone and the others woke up long after morning. After making fun of each other for a while, they took a bath.
By the time I returned the books to the library and went to school, lunch break was over. It was class time, so the campus was quiet, and cleaners were sweeping the stone roads.
“This is the end, our vacation.”
“What about vacation? Is a suspension a vacation?”
“You had fun, though. what are you going to do now?”
Shirone turned to the inn and said.
“I’m going to go in and start tidying up the room. I have class from tomorrow, so I have to clean it up today.”
“Anyway, I need to know what to be strict about. okay. Then we’ll be at the study group, so come if you’re bored.”
“okay. See you later.”
After parting with her friends, Shirone returned to her lodgings. While he was preparing for the recital, the room was a mess because he wasn’t paying attention. He rolled up his sleeves and started cleaning, putting his class materials in order into the bookshelf, and finally shaking his hands.
A one-week suspension that came without notice.
But I did gain something. No, it was a realization beyond what I had learned so far in school.
‘It’s finally normal class. I hope tomorrow comes soon.’
It was only natural that my progress was delayed, and I intended to focus on my classes even if I had to reduce my study group activities for the time being.
‘Nade and Eruki must be the same.’
The eyes of the friends I saw at the inn were burning with a passion for learning. It was thanks to the clear goal of being promoted to Class Four by the end of this semester.
At the end of each semester, Alpheas Magic School decides who will be promoted by reflecting the grades of the first half of the semester, and the cut-off was over 80 points in all subjects. It was a terrifying level of difficulty where you had to score 80 points or more in all subjects, not an average of 80 points.
Of course, it was not an impossible score, but it was true that it was difficult for any student. This is because there are bound to be weak subjects depending on individual aptitude.
Nevertheless, the school’s educational policy was firm.
Acquiring knowledge in all fields to a certain level or higher before entering a major.
So, if you were a graduate of a magic school, you had to see that you could use all the basic magic of each series. It was also the reason why graduates were given preferential treatment in the forefront of the magical society.
Not all current wizards graduated from magic schools. The percentage of students from non-magical schools who became disciples of wizards, gained enlightenment, or learned magic through the dark route could not be ignored.
Their strengths are that they have a lot of experience in the field and use magic suitable for practice. However, there were also disadvantages of lack of understanding of magic and low potential for development compared to those who graduated from magic schools.
Who to hire depends on the nature of the job, but it was true that graduates from magic schools had an advantage in getting a job. As such, the 80 points presented by the school was a standard considering the modern social situation.
“ha. So what? In my case, it means that you have to raise your average by at least 30 points.”
No matter what realization Shirone had, this was a school. In order to be promoted, a score of 80 or more was required.
It is not impossible if you use the framework of knowledge. In addition, if you prepare for the presentation and reinforce the knowledge you have gained while studying God Particles, your score will increase considerably.
But even considering that, I thought the probability of being promoted was about 30 percent.
‘No, isn’t it rather great? If it’s 30% to be promoted to Class 4 in half a year.’
Shirone thought positively. Isn’t that a good enough chance to try? If Nade and Eruki are promoted and only you remain in Class 5… … The thought alone was terrifying.
In addition, once you enter Class Four, you will be able to apply for the senior class. In that case, she would also keep her promise to Amy.
“omg! right! Amy!”
We never met after the presentation. At the time, she was so excited that she didn’t even think about finding her.
‘Oh, I should have said hello. I was too careless.’
Amy was a grateful friend who supported me whenever I faced a difficult challenge. She said she would be her strength this time. As she walks out of her lodgings with such thoughts, it is in Shirone’s eyes that her playfulness is childish.
“Whoops! Will you be surprised?”
* * *
Shirone headed to her senior year with two cups of coffee in each hand. One belonged to Amy, and the other belonged to Seriel. A bitter smile appeared on her lips as she recalled the past of running Amy’s coffee errands.
‘At that time, I really thought the world was collapsing.’
Looking back, it was a bad relationship.
Who knew that the poor girl he met in an alley at the age of twelve would now be friends with?
Shirone climbed the hill of the senior class. An arch called a steel door stood at the entrance. I didn’t know it when I saw it from a distance, but it was a much bigger structure than I thought.
‘This is the pinnacle of magic school.’
Passing under the structure that symbolizes the wizard’s spirit, Shirone’s heart somehow became solemn.
When the 6th period class ended, the seniors came out. Shirone shouted when he found Amy and Seriel conversing on the main porch.
“Amy! Amy!”
The seniors turned their heads, but Amy and Seriel were still engrossed in the conversation as if they hadn’t heard. Then, Shirone, who was playful, went behind her and held out coffee in front of Amy’s eyes.
“Voila! Surprise!”
Amy opened her eyes wide in surprise. Shirone gave her coffee to Seriel with her big smile.
“Here, I also have seniors. Eat this and cheer up!”
Seriel tilted her head. Amy blinked her eyes as well, and she said with a frown.
“What are you? Who is giving us coffee?”

[78] Dark Uninvited Guest (2)
Shirone thought that Amy was kicking back as a joke.
“Sorry. Are you surprised? I didn’t tell you to surprise you. How is your senior class?”
Amy showed a look of caution. Then, when Shirone tried to come closer, she hurriedly slapped him on the arm. The two cups of coffee she was holding flew away.
Shirone put on a blank expression. I couldn’t see this as a joke. Amy’s face was also flushed red, as if she were really angry.
“Who are you doing this to? And while you say you are a senior to Seriel, why are you talking mean things to me?”
Seriel also showed a displeased look, as if this wasn’t the case.
“Are you in the advanced class? No matter how interested you are, isn’t this kind of approach a little out of place? And you should use respectful words for seniors. What’s this? Not even a fly.”
Shirone was dumbfounded. Amy and Seriel were acting as if they didn’t know themselves.
“Seriel-senpai, this is me, Shirone. don’t you know me? Amy, do I really not know? Are you kidding me?”
“How do I know you? If you are a student, please study. Annoyingly, can’t you tell the time and place? Do I look that easy?”
Amy grabbed Shirone by the collar. I was really annoyed. She thought that by the time she reached her senior year, she would say goodbye to all the troublesome men, and she would follow her all the way here.
‘I wanted to be quiet for a while, but it’s starting again. This is all because the child is not changing. He hangs out with strange kids and goes around doing nonsense… … .’
Amy muttered inwardly and tilted her head.
‘what? the child? Who is that?’
There must have been a certain person involved in the reason why the male students at Chigeundae dropped out, but I couldn’t remember.
Caught by the collar, Shirone felt as though her heart had been pierced. There was no intimacy in Amy’s eyes.
“no… … This is not it.”
Shirone shook Amy’s hand that was holding her by the collar.
“no! Do not lie!”
“ouch.”
Amy clenched her wrist and put on a painful expression. However, Shirone shouted as if he hated even that appearance.
“Why are you pretending not to know! what did i do wrong If you don’t like it, just say no! If it’s like this, I’m offended too!”
“you! go away!”
Seriel pushed Shirone away. Since it was Seriel and no one else, Shirone couldn’t even resist and slammed his ass.
“Why are you bullying my friend? Even for seniors! where is your class Do you really want to get scolded?”
Shirone looked up at her with a world-lost face.
‘Siriel… … .’
Amy’s best friend. She always tops the list with her outstanding skills, but she was a natural girl who would shed tears while watching her romance novels. She remembers Shirone. The way she enthusiastically cheered her on whenever she took on a tough challenge.
But now she was a completely different person. Her eyes were on fire and her pursed lips were tinged with hostility.
Shirone shook her head. He wasn’t unbelievable, he didn’t want to believe. This could never happen.
“no! It is a lie!”
Shirone slipped to his feet and ran. I felt like I would go crazy if I stayed here for even one second.
“Don’t come again! If you mess around like this one more time, I’ll tell the teacher!”
Seriel, who made a hand trumpet and shouted, said to Amy, frowning as if she was still angry.
“Ugh, what kind of kids do you have? Her face has a gentle look, but she is very tenacious. oh my, Amy. Are you okay?”
“huh? Oh, it’s okay.”
Amy, lost in thought, suddenly came to her senses. But she still felt uneasy. It was because she felt a strange longing for Shirone as she walked away.
“Who are you? Are you acting like you really know me?”
“I guess I just pretended to be crazy and bumped into it. Because there are a lot of kids like that these days. Unsympathetic to try to cross someone.”
“is it?”
“Anyway, I’ll go in. Hey, I was going to talk to you for a while, but the break time was over because of the weird kid.”
Even in the same graduating class, they had different majors, so it was difficult for them to find time to ask each other’s regards if they didn’t make time for each other.
As Seriel entered the classroom, Amy followed. But she stopped going into the front door and looked back at the place where Shirone had run.
“… … .”
Until the class bell rang, she stayed in her seat.
* * *
‘Why are you doing that! What could be the reason!’
Shirone ran like crazy. After passing through the steel door and arriving at the advanced class building, the class bell rang and students entered the classroom.
“mark! mark!”
Mark, who was flirting with Maria, turned his head. Shirone ran up to him and asked him.
“mark! do you know me Who am I! Tell me quickly!”
Mark looked back at Maria, embarrassed. But she shrugged her shoulders as if Maria didn’t know either.
“excuse me… … who are you?”
Shirone’s heart started beating like crazy. He couldn’t figure out what the hell had happened to him.
“it’s me. It’s me.”
“So who are you? I need to talk to know.”
“it’s me! It’s Shirone! Class Five! I took the test with you too! Do you really not know?”
Mark’s expression wrinkled. However, he couldn’t argue with the class five and bowed his head politely.
“Ah yes. I’m sorry I didn’t know.”
“That’s not it! Why are you treating me that way!”
What are you saying to yourself? I wanted to get rid of it according to my nature, but I couldn’t because there was attention from others.
“You guys, class started, but you didn’t go in. What are you doing?”
Siena was walking from the hallway. Shirone rushed to her in her mood to meet her savior.
“teacher! It’s me, Shirone!”
If it was Siena-sensei, there was no way she would forget herself. because she is strong She’s a certified 6th class wizard. But her return words were cruel.
“Shirone? There is no such student in the advanced class. who are you?”
“Sir, don’t you know me? This is Shirone.”
Siena looked back at her memories. But she was a name she didn’t know, a face she didn’t know.
“I think something went wrong. I hadn’t heard of a freshman coming. Are you really a student at our school?”
Mark and Maria’s eyes changed sharply. Shirone, who suddenly became a suspicious person, suddenly became frightened.
“I’m sorry! I was mistaken!”
“Hey! Stop there!”
Leaving behind Siena’s voice, Shirone desperately ran away. I seemed to know now. what happened
Everyone has forgotten themselves.
“Ugh, black… … .”
I felt like a lost child. he was infinitely weak. I felt afraid of everything in the world.
After entering Eastas, Shirone got lost three times before arriving at the Supernatural Psychic Research Society.
‘My friends will be fine. Of course, why not?’
Hadn’t we been exchanging jokes just a few hours ago? Even if everyone in the world forgot, they deserved to be remembered.
When I opened the door and entered, Nade and Eruki were chatting. Then, when she saw Shirone, she made a surprised expression.
“Nade, Eruki, it’s me. I am Shirone.”
My friends just blinked their eyes without answering. As the dam of emotions that had been blocked up until now collapsed, Shirone’s face turned into a tear-stain.
“Why are you not talking? do you remember me You haven’t forgotten, have you?”
Nade looked back at Eruki. Then he came over to Shirone scratching her head.
“excuse me… … who are you?”
Tears glistened in Shirone’s eyes.
“I really don’t know? We were together until now. We studied together yesterday and the day before!”
“I’m sorry, but we don’t know you. Did another research society send it to spy on you? Please don’t mess around and leave.”
Eruki shouted as if he had suddenly realized.
“for a moment! Maybe that’s possible. How did you find the path to Estas? tell me soon! Who the hell are you?”
“You, you… … .”
Shirone’s lower lip protruded. I couldn’t stop crying anymore. No, I didn’t even want to bear it.
“pooh… … .”
Air leaked from Nade’s mouth. Then he grabbed her stomach and burst into laughter.
“Puhahaha! did you see Did you see this expression? This is a complete masterpiece!”
“saw! saw! Totally terrified, you, you… … . Ha ha ha! Shirone, what are you trying to do by making me laugh?”
Nade laughed so much that he grabbed his aching stomach and staggered.
“Uh-huh, uh-huh! Oh, the more I think about it, the more I go crazy! Why the hell would you do this… … Ha ha ha!”
Shirone did not understand the situation. I couldn’t even tell if it was real or a dream.
“What, do you remember me?”
“What nonsense are you talking about? Did you suddenly have a nightmare? Do you know how funny your face is right now? Fuhahaha!”
Shirone’s pulse went out of whack. It felt like the boulder on his chest had finally rolled off.
“Ah, sir! Then you don’t have to talk! Why the hell did you pretend not to know?”
“When I came in, the expression on my face was so funny that I was joking around. you were like this me, it’s me It’s Shirone.”
When Nade imitated Shirone, Eruki hit the floor again and fell to his stomach. Shirone, who didn’t even have the energy to criticize, sat down and covered her face with her hands.
“Whoa, I thought you were really scared to death.”
“Sit down for a moment. What is it?”
Sitting on the sofa, Shirone enthusiastically confessed the situation from a moment ago. At first, the children, who were foolish, became serious when the topic of Siena-sensei came out.
“Hmm, you mean you don’t even know Siena-sensei? There’s no way the teacher was playing a joke.”
Nade couldn’t believe it at all.
“Is that really possible?”
“It is possible with spirit-type magic. Of course, it is doubtful whether it is possible to manipulate the memories of all students.”
“Because it is possible. I’ve been through it myself.”
Eruki calmed down the pounding Shirone.
“okay. don’t get excited just because it is Anyway, I believe in what you say. It means people have lost their memories of you.”
said Nade.
“But we do remember. Could this passage be a hint for the situation?”
“i think so too. I can only think of one reason why we haven’t forgotten Shirone. That you haven’t been to school for two days. What the hell happened while we were gone?”
Shirone and the others were lost in thought. While they were gone, someone manipulated the minds of not only the students but also the teachers? It was an assumption that didn’t make sense right away.
“Maybe something supernatural has happened? If you look at the examples, there are quite a few similar things historically.”
Eruki was skeptical.
“Well. Although I think that case has to do with magic too. Anyway, if that’s the case, how does that explain why we haven’t lost our memories?”
“Maybe it was because I was in Estas. We’ve been here ever since we broke up with Shirone.”
Shirone asked.
“What does that have to do with Estas?”
“It has been rumored that Estas has mystical powers for a long time. Of course, it’s a rumor, but I’m trying to do everything I can think of. It has to do with our personal affairs.”
said Eruki.
“That means there’s a chance we’ll lose our memories too.”
“Because I can’t be certain.”
Silence passed. It would be sad that people couldn’t remember, but it was also a problem that they lost their memories.
Nade spoke up courageously.
“still… … Would you like to go out and see?”
“Well, it’s not something that can be solved by hiding, right?”
Friends were right. However, Shirone, who had already been through terrible things, did not like it.
“Then what if you all forget me too? I might really go crazy by then.”
“Let’s do this. to be marked in advance. Even if you lose your memory, you can avoid the worst.”

[79] Dark Uninvited Guest (3)
Nade picked up a pen and wrote something in the palm of his hand. Friends who were watching her also engraved the same inscription.
– I lost my memory. A person who knows the keywords is a trustworthy person. The keyword is the North Star.
Shirone and the others spread their palms in satisfaction. If you mark it like this, even if you lose your memory, you will cooperate.
“Okay, okay? Let’s go out now.”
Having regained her confidence, Shirone escaped from Istas.
After class, students were going to and from the campus. When I regained my composure and looked around, there were not one or two strange things.
Students who would normally walk around in groups of three, three, five, were moving individually. What was strangest of all was the fact that the lines of movement were jumbled even though he was busy walking.
“Guys, those people… … .”
“know. I felt it too. There is no destination. Aren’t you just walking around as you please?”
Nade found an acquaintance in the crowd. He was Gabe, Class Five’s motive.
“Hey, Gabe. Where are you going?”
Gabe has arrived. Then he asked in a dry tone, as if he were talking to someone he had never seen before.
“Who are you?”
Nade pursed his lips. But since she had already heard what Shirone had been through, she didn’t mind and asked her questions first.
“No, done. Where are you going?”
“Where am I going?”
Nade said while beating his chest in frustration.
“You were on your way now. Where is your destination?”
“I?”
Gabe looked down at his legs. Then he began to look around him like a man who had suddenly realized himself.
“here is… … Where are you?”
“Hey, calm down. Why are you doing this? what happened in the past few days? Did you see any suspicious people?”
“Could you… … I know?”
“Of course you know. How can you not know?”
Gabe’s face went pale. He suddenly approached and grabbed Nade by the shoulder and shook him.
“Then tell me! Who am I? No, where the hell are you? me… … what is my name?”
As a terrified Gabe clutched his head, Nade slowly backed away and prepared for the unexpected. Fortunately, Gabe didn’t turn aggressive. He was just going crazy.
“What are you talking about? I hear a strange noise! Why do I keep hearing this!”
Gabe’s tongue began to twist as he shouted as he looked around. Suddenly, a strange sound that I couldn’t understand at all came out.
Shirone’s eyes widened in shock. Gabe realized what state he was in. On the other hand, Eruki listened to the sounds around him as if he hadn’t noticed yet.
“What do you hear? Is it hallucination?”
Shirone said in a trembling voice.
“No, you are listening to your own voice.”
“what? Your own voice?”
“I can’t remember the language. You spit out the words out of habit, but you don’t know the meaning. So I have no choice but to be afraid.”
Gabe had completely forgotten the language system. He finally let out a sound like a caveman, as if he had forgotten even the syllables.
Shirone and the others were creepy. Judging from the speed at which the mind degenerated, the memory was fading quite quickly.
As time passed, Gabe’s voice faded, his eyes lost their vitality, and eventually he lost his ability to exercise. At the same time… … Everyone in the street stopped moving.
A terrifying silence came to the magic school. As if a wax figure had been set up, no one showed any signs of moving.
“why… … What happened?”
“Anyway, we are all right. I’m not optimistic, but there’s room for a little more investigation.”
Shirone looked at the people one by one. It felt like the world stopped, like Armin’s stop magic. But time was definitely passing. Besides, seeing that people blinked every once in a while, I wasn’t even frozen.
“I think… … It stopped.”
If it was a kind of magic, it was a more dangerous effect than the stop. You can pose a threat to your opponent. Even a child could have harmed everyone in this room if he put his mind to it.
The three walked into the crowd and did some experiments. When he tickled his junior, he burst into laughter. However, as soon as the tickling stopped, it returned to a firm expression. He blinked his eyelids as he threatened to stab him in the eye. It was said that the nerves were alive.
“Oh, I guess you just stopped thinking. Is this unusual?”
“Then, it means that physical strength also has its limits. You won’t last long standing still. What are you doing?”
“Who has done this before? Let’s look around a little more.”
Shirone and the others headed north. It was to make sure that seniors and teachers with high magic levels were in the same situation.
By the time we reached the uphill road, seniors were slipping through the arch of the steel gate.
Shirone and the others hid themselves in the bushes.
The fact that only the senior class was moving in a situation where everyone could not move was reason enough to be wary.
In the crowd of seniors, I saw a face I hadn’t seen before.
It was a man and a woman who seemed to be the same age as Shirone, and a man who was wearing twin swords that didn’t match at all with the magic school.
Lucas whistled and smirked.
“Hwiyu, I’ve seen many gruesome scenes in my life, but this is the first time I’ve seen such a dreary scene. Aren’t they all turned into zombies?”
Abyss Nova is a magic that blocks the memories of people exposed to Nova within 24 hours. It was no exaggeration to say that it was an inanimate magic because thinking is impossible without memory. The order in which the memories were blocked was from the most recent, most impressive memory first.
It was Arin’s mission to lead those whose memories were blocked. Specializing in spirit-type magic, she brought the seniors to the campus where Shirone and the others encountered Gabe.
‘The shadow of capture.’
And there he cast his magic again. She pierced people’s shadows as her shadows meandered like tentacles.
A unique form that does not exist in four ways. However, it was a tentacle type called standard for spirit-type wizards.
The tentacle type is much more flexible than the four type because it uses the spirit zone by unwinding it like a thin thread.
However, it took a long time, and it took at least 20 minutes to pass all the shadows of the advanced students.
While Arin was working, Lucas passed the time by judging the female students. Since they were nobles, all of them had pale skin and smelled good. Scanning her figure with a viper’s eye, Lucas stopped when he saw a woman he liked.
“Oh my. See this?”
Even in the state of losing her memory, she was a girl with clear eyes. She was retro-styled, with her reddish bangs falling over one eye, but her look was the best of her students.
“There must be some personality. I like ferocious women.”
The moment Lucas’s hand reached out to Amy, Canis grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him around.
“Lucas, stop it. Please refrain from doing anything rude.”
“what? Lucas, can you stop? Are you talking to me just now?”
“I won’t let you go if you do useless things.”
“pooh!”
Lucas let out a weak laugh. Has the status of the parrot bandits fallen this far?
“Hey, what’s so serious? From what I’ve heard, it’s a revenge play anyway. Why don’t we have some fun?”
“This is revenge to regain Master’s pride. I will not forgive you for doing bad things.”
“What if I don’t forgive you? Would you like to stick around here?”
“I will terminate the employment contract.”
“haha! Little boy, you seem to be mistaken, but I was hired by Arcane, not by you.”
“It’s like anything. Arin is casting Shadow of Capture. You can be fired at any time for any behavior that interferes with the operation. Of course, if you are dissatisfied with that… … .”
A whirlwind of abyss arose in Canis’ pupils.
“I will kill you on the spot.”
Lucas sighed and stepped back. Having defeated countless wizards before becoming the vice-captain of the parrot thieves, he knew how dangerous it was to show hostility in the Spirit Zone.
“I am Quit. Anyway, if I don’t pay, I’m the only one who loses.”
“Tell me clearly. If you interfere with our work one more time, then I will not stand it.”
“Your co-workers are very strict with each other. A person called a teacher can’t even poke his nose. Where the hell have you been?”
“Master is making important preparations. Simple things like this mean we can work it out ourselves.”
Arcane was currently in hiding and recovering the mental power that had been exhausted by Abyss Nova. However, Canis hid the fact because it wouldn’t do any good to tell him.
“Nungnung, I’m sure you’ll be fine.”
Lucas’s eyes shone intensely for a short moment after answering evasively and turning around.
‘Hey, I’m sure he’s hiding somewhere.’
Lucas was quick about the magician’s equivalent exchange. If it was a magic that blocked hundreds of people’s memories, it was a level that ordinary wizards couldn’t even try. Even if he was a great wizard, it was clear that he would not be able to use his full power for a while.
‘It’s only now that you’re bluffing, kid. There’s no way I’ll miss this fun opportunity, right?’
After Arin’s work was finished, the senior and advanced students started to move together. Only after they got out of sight did Shirone and the others get out of the bush. From what I’ve seen, it seems that he intends to take the entire school somewhere.
“Who the heck are those?”
“I don’t have time to think. It won’t be much for a while, but I don’t know what they’ll do when they reach their destination. Besides, even the teachers were arrested.”
Shirone said.
“I thought the magic the girl cast was dark magic. If so, is the current situation something they did?”
“I think the chances of that happening are slim. In order to cast magic of this magnitude, John’s size must be enormous. Two of the three are too young, and one is likely not a wizard, as he is carrying a weapon.”
“You mean there is a third person?”
“I guess so. For now, let’s just focus on tracking. If someone is in a dangerous situation, it’s not too late to act.”
“To take control of the magic school? He’s crazy. Moreover, it is dark magic… … .”
With an unknown ominous feeling, Shirone and the others followed the uninvited guests.
* * *
Ethella stayed at the training center wearing the same outfit as yesterday. Her eyebrows twitched as she didn’t even move in her cross-legged position. Her brow wrinkled and her nose twisted. Biting off her molars, she began to vibrate violently, causing veins to form in her neck.
Deed deed deed deed.
The building shook following Ethella’s body. Dust poured down as the walls and ceiling vibrated. Finally opening her eyes, she let out her rough breath and collapsed in front of her.
“ha! ha!”
Ethella’s whole body was wet with cold sweat as she struggled all night with Simma who came to her at dawn.
‘What was it?’
I couldn’t pinpoint it, but it was the kind that penetrates people’s heads and blocks their memories. Dark magic belongs to the orthodox school, but the malice contained in magic was strong enough to push Ethella’s vigilance to the extreme. Had it not been for the laws of the Order of Charsis, she would have lost her memory forever.
‘It’s dark magic. But they must be strictly forbidden on campus.’
Ethella checked the time. It was summer, so it was as bright as daytime, but it was time to stay even after school was over.
‘You mean you’ve been trapped in Shimma for over 12 hours?’
Considering Ethella’s pure and pure spirit, it was a very powerful magic. What’s even more shocking is that even though she completely skipped class, no one came to visit this place.
It’s not just you.
Ethella, who had gone so far in her thoughts, ran out of the training center without even having time to change her clothes.
* * *
A flash of light passed over the magic school. Then, as if attracted by a magnet, it bent toward the ground and plummeted. One man landed without even a sound of impact.

[80] Unwelcome Guest of Darkness (4)
“damn! Are you late?”
Thaad, who had been riding a carriage all night, used space travel as soon as she entered Creas and arrived at the front door. As expected, the guards just stood there, not showing any reaction.
It was dark magic.
It is also of a very high level.
‘I have to find Master first.’
Sad turned to the teachers’ quarters. But before he had even taken ten steps, he heard a roar from the sky that was characteristic of space travel.
At the same time as Thaad, alerted, entered the Spirit Zone, Ethella descended on the light.
“Teacher Ethella! How are things?”
When Thaad, who had just returned from a business trip, asked a question as if he knew what had happened at the school, Ethella was puzzled. However, he was fighting for time, so he went straight to the point.
“I think I was struck by dark magic. All the students and teachers lost their memories.”
I expected it, but when it came to reality, Thaad was staggering. No matter how crazy he is, he raided Alpheas Magic School, one of the five most prestigious schools in the kingdom.
“There is no time. Please tell me the situation first.”
“When I searched through the Spirit Zone, all the students were climbing the mountain. Looking at the direction, it seems to be the bridge you can’t cross. There are 3 leaders and 3 people tailing them. Among teachers… … I guess I was the only one who barely got out.”
Arcane’s dark magic has risen to the ranks of the archmage, but since Ethella is also the bishop of the Karsis Monastery, she would not have been able to control her mind. She explained what Thaad knew, thinking that she was lucky.
“I will tell you quickly. The person who did this was Viltor Arcane. This is the great wizard who disturbed the world 40 years ago.”
“I have heard of it. Why would such a person go to magic school… … ?”
Thaad bit her lip. He was in the bad personal history of his mentor, Alfeas. However, the only person she could rely on now was Ethella, and if she was her own person, she would accept her without prejudice.
“Viltor Arcane is the principal’s teacher.”
Ethella blinked. However, as Thaad expected, he did not imagine more than what he had heard.
“okay. But I don’t think there are any Arcanes among those taking the students. I don’t know what’s going on, but it’s better to save the students first.”
“It’s not possible. As Miss Ethella must have felt, it’s not easy to get rid of mental magic. If you try to save her students one by one, you’ll end up backfired.”
“You can’t just leave it alone.”
“They said there were three people tailing them. Can you guess who it is?”
“I couldn’t be sure, but… … Maybe it could be Shirone.”
“Is it Shirone?”
The moment I heard Ethella’s words, I immediately thought of Thaad. The point at which Arcane’s magic was cast would be around 24 hours. The only students who could be out of school during that time were the suspended Shirone and the others.
“I’m not sure because I haven’t checked the appearance. But in terms of temperament, they were like Shirone, Nade, and Eruki.”
“Perhaps it is. Those kids will be fine for a while. They’re smart kids, so they’ll know what to do. Rather, leave it to the children and Mr. Ethella, please find Arcane.”
“What are you going to do, Mr. Thaad?”
“I will find the principal. The priority is to find Master and remove the dark magic.”
Ethella nodded in agreement.
“all right. Then I will find Arcane.”
Thaad looked back at the ridge. The land of the magic school was so large that I had no idea where Arcane was.
“Hundreds of people were hit simultaneously. A magic of this magnitude would have exhausted his mental power considerably. It’s most likely hiding in an uninhabited place. It will be quicker to search around the mountain. What is the radius of the spirit zone when expanded in zoner mode?”
“Well, about two kilometers in diameter.”
Thaad, who calculated the estimate, nodded.
“At least five points and you’ll be fine. Please patrol based on the training ground. I will go to school.”
“yes. I will capture Arcane and save the students.”
“Don’t push yourself too hard. Arcane is… … .”
Thaad swallowed. Even if she says her opponent is strong, she will only burn her sense of duty. Who else would you trust if you didn’t trust Jonah, the Bishop of the Order of Carsis and recognized by the state?
“no. please.”
Thaad, feeling the responsibility as a disciple of Alpheas, bowed his head in place of his master. Then Ethella shook her head with a shy smile.
“I don’t know what it is, but I am also a teacher at this school. I will do my best for my students.”
“yes. then… … .”
From now on, it was a race against time.
As Thaad teleported and flew towards the school, Ethella took a deep breath and concentrated.
As the sequence of events went up at super-high speed, the spirit zone expanded. As Jonner’s unique expanse unfolded, everything within a two kilometer radius was felt through synesthesia.
‘First, to the 26th training ground.’
Ethella’s body turned into light and flew to the top of the mountain. It was she who covered one kilometer in one space movement.
Wizard’s Battle (1)
Canis and the others gathered the memory-blocked people at the starting point of the bridge they couldn’t cross.
After completing the mission, Arin’s face was pale. Even if she was affected by Abyss Nova, moving hundreds of humans to mind control was an enormous amount of hard work.
Nade, who was watching Canis and the others in the bush, said.
“Why are you here? It’s just a bridge and a cliff.”
“I don’t know. Aren’t you waiting for someone?”
Eruki said, pointing his fingers one by one.
“Cliffs, mind control, scoundrels. If you look at these three factors alone, the answer is obvious. I’m thinking of dropping you off a cliff.”
“What? Why are you doing such crazy things?”
“Logically, it makes no sense. There’s nothing to be gained by dropping the student. But what about emotional issues? Something like resentment or revenge.”
Shirone thought it made sense. Also, if he really did, he wasn’t good at waiting like this.
“We have to step in before that happens. Maybe we should fight.”
Nothing happened for 10 minutes. The students and teachers stood in a state of mind control, while Canis and Arin looked out over the cliff and waited for their master.
“Are you really okay, Canis? You searched all over the school, but you couldn’t bring Alfeas, right?”
“I can’t help it. Master also told you to be especially careful when you meet Alfeas. We just have to do what we can.”
“still… … I think I’m going to get scolded somehow.”
Canis looked back at Arin with a displeased face.
“scale. Master is a good person. Don’t worry, I’ll never scold you for something like this.”
Lucas, who had been listening to the conversation between the two, began to get annoyed. Although he came as a large sum of money, he did not know that he would commit terrorism against the entire magic school.
Considering the difficulty of the mission, the advance payment was small. Besides, Arcane had not yet appeared even though it was well past the appointed time.
“hey. When the hell is your master coming? Could it be that he ran away?”
It was an incident that raided the five most prestigious families in the kingdom. Considering that most of the students were first-class nobles, even if this incident ended safely, the aftermath would be enormous. Even the archmage couldn’t rule out the possibility that he might have run away in fear.
“Don’t judge Master carelessly. Because you’re not the kind of person to talk about it.”
“ha. I’m so dumbfounded.”
Lucas scratched his head angrily. Then he suddenly raised his head and glared at Canis with viper eyes he hadn’t seen before.
“You, do I look so easy?”
Arin, who has excellent emotional sensitivity, hurriedly retreated as the hostility beyond the normal level surged. On the other hand, Canis had a calm expression. If it was this look, he had suffered countless times in Radum.
‘Is it the evil eye?’
It paralyzes the central nervous system by hitting the diencephalon with the gaze, and it was one of the schema skills that are expressed through actual combat experience and innate tendencies rather than training. Just by looking at the way he used Sarn, he could guess what kind of life Lucas lived.
“It’s over when you look at me as a child. You’d better be careful with your words from now on. He said something about the contract, but isn’t it on your side that the work is delayed?”
Canis couldn’t even refute this time. Why is Master not coming? It was obviously strange that he, who had been waiting for this day more than anyone else, would be late.
As Canis remained silent and reaped his fighting spirit, Lucas also solved the case. Anyway, it was still one team, and more than anything else, there was still work to be paid.
‘I wasn’t following you from the beginning.’
Lucas looked back at those affected by Abyss Nova. Their metabolism is normal, so there is not much time left for them to stand still. It will be more complicated to deal with if stamina starts to go down first.
“Hey, why don’t you just kill it now? Even if you faint, it’ll be difficult. You can’t even throw them away.”
Lucas was hired as a professional swordsman. A mage was good for reaping the lives of many, but there was nothing better than a swordsman to slit the throats of survivors one by one. In the end, when his stamina was depleted, it all belonged to Lucas, so he was thinking of reducing the number in advance.
“Not until Master comes. The core of the operation is to annihilate them in front of Alpheas.”
“Sheesh, then let’s have some fun. After a while, everything will fall off the cliff anyway.”
Canis glared at him as if he was disgusted, but there was no reason to stop him in the current situation. A native of Radum, he knows how dangerous a man like Lucas can be. In the end, Lucas will have to do what he wants. He shuddered at it.
“A piece of trash.”
Lucas’ steps stopped abruptly. He should have killed Canis in the first matter. Because the human brain adapts to shock, repeating the subject to the same subject was less effective.
“Keuk, do you know why I hate you? You pretend to have some great beliefs. You and I are just criminals. After today, you too will become a murderer who has exterminated hundreds of people.”
“I don’t keep my beliefs because I want to be great. I just hate people like you.”
“haha? okay? You know what’s really disgusting? They’re weak and talkative. What if you are disgusted?”
Lucas turned around and grabbed Siena by the neck. Her face contorted, she lifted her body with one hand and took her stride to the precipice of the impassable bridge.
“Once you kill one person, you’ll find out. That you are trash just like me.”
Lucas held out his arms, and Siena’s legs swayed off the cliff. A groaning noise erupted from his mouth.
“This woman is fine too. It’s a waste to kill her, but… … .”
Lucas relaxed his hands and dropped Siena. At the same time, sparks flew in his eyes. Feels like fluff. It was a stimulus unique to the Spirit Zone that only schema users could feel.
‘Where is it?’
A sensitive nervous system picked up the focus of the Spirit Zone. As he soared into the air, there was a pop and explosion where his right knee had been. Had he been hit squarely, his bones would have been broken.
As soon as he landed, Lucas did a somersault and stepped back. Even if you couldn’t guess the radius of the spirit zone, keeping the distance as much as possible was the standard before the Archmage.

Chapter - 81 - Wizard's Battle (2) 3.txt
===============================
[81] Wizard’s Battle (2)
Nade and Eruki, who cast teleportation, appeared in front of the cliff of a bridge that could not be crossed. The eyes of the two people who watched Siena’s humiliation were burning with fire.
“How dare you, the teacher… … .”
“What, there were some fine guys, right? Anyway, sorcerers… … .”
Lucas felt the same way. To think that a person with the name of a great wizard made the mistake of missing the target. Besides, all sane humans had to deal with themselves.
“Was that woman a teacher? I’m sorry. She should have almost arrived by now. it’s on the ground Kuck.”
The moment Lucas finished speaking, Shirone hugged Siena from the bottom of the cliff and teleported up. His eyes were no different from those of his friends. How far must he fall before he can drop a man down a cliff?
“I will not forgive you.”
Lucas didn’t even listen. The escalating situation was just annoying.
“hey. What are you going to do? Is this also part of the operation?”
Lucas made it clear who was responsible. It’s because he can come out when he pays the balance. Canis also did not evade. In the absence of Arcane, he was the leader.
“Arin, stay back.”
“But Canis… … .”
“You don’t have to step out. Focus on the task of controlling people. I’ll take care of it myself.”
It was unreasonable to fight hundreds of people with mental control. As Arin hid among the people, Canis, relieved, approached Shirone and the others.
“What are you? How did you get out of mind control?”
Eruki said.
“Dark magic, isn’t it magic that is already outdated? The law of destruction is widespread and widespread.”
“No nonsense. If it could have been solved that easily, the guys in the back wouldn’t have been caught.”
‘That’s right… … .’
Canis looked up at the sun. It was the peak of the mountain, so the light was still strong. However, there would be no need for the student of the archmage to set conditions against the students.
Lucas, who was watching with his arms crossed, shouted.
“Hey, what are you going to do? This wasn’t in the contract. I could handle it for you for double the money.”
“I don’t need any help. I handle it myself.”
“Then whatever.”
Lucas sighed and stepped back. He had the attitude of not wanting to step out, but his heart was the exact opposite. He waits pretending not to care, then slashes them from behind when the battle starts. Then it was over.
“Come on quickly. Because you are busy.”
Shirone and Canis slowly closed the distance. Canis’ spirit zone, felt through synesthesia, was a sphere with a diameter of approximately 50 meters, similar to Shirone’s.
“I’ll be in charge here, so you guys stop that prosecutor.”
Eruki turned to Lucas at Shirone’s words.
“That person? Judging by the atmosphere, I don’t think I will go out.”
“I don’t know how things will change when they come. He’s vicious enough to make Siena-sensei fall off a cliff.”
Shirone looked back with cold eyes and said.
“Don’t believe anything he says.”
Eruki swallowed his saliva. Shirone, who switched the circuits in her head to a combat readiness, looked different from usual.
Shirone began timing. Photon output boasts outstanding activation speed among attack magic. However, the dark series also did not lag behind in speed.
No signal could be read in Canis’ eyes. Like an orangutan’s black pupil, only an uncertain future hovered around.
not human Extremely animalistic eyes that can only be obtained by those who have survived countless times.
What kind of life would lead to such eyes?
The two wiggled their fingers. And the moment the bird flew up, it moved at the same time. The photon output and the power of darkness moved dazzlingly, disturbing my eyes.
Shirone cast teleportation and soared. The power of darkness that followed vertically melted in the sunlight.
Canis laughed. What he was aiming for was the shadow buried on the ground, not Shirone’s body. After belatedly recalling the properties of dark magic, Shirone hurriedly moved off the cliff. As the shadow disappeared 1,000 meters below, the power of darkness that missed its target dissipated like flames.
As the photon output shot like a rapid-fire cannon, Canis cast a shadow wall. A thick wall of shadow rose before his eyes and he absorbed all the photons.
‘It’s a great strength. Darkness blocks the light.’
Dark power to the extent of going against the laws of nature. Shirone, who had increased the power of photon output through thousands of rebounds, could guess how strong Canis’ mental strength was.
‘Then how about this?’
After concentrating the photon in her hand, Shirone gnashed her teeth and threw it. As the photon cannon fired, Canis maximized the thickness of the defense wall. The corner of his mouth went up for a moment, as the shadow wall exploded and a flash came in.
‘What is this?’
Feeling creepy, Canis instinctively cast Dark Skin. As his body turned black, a photon cannon hit his stomach.
“Ouch… … !”
The limit of the shock that Dark Skin could absorb had already been exceeded at the moment of collision, and the shock wave shook the internal organs. Canis’ body, which flew away with both legs floating, was buried in the forest.
“Canis!”
Arin couldn’t believe it. Light contains physical force. Light is just pure energy. If it contained even a small amount of physical force, all the planets where the sun was would have been smashed.
Lucas’ expression also became serious for the first time. A magic that strikes the opponent by rapidly flying a beam of light. Even if he had been confident in Canis’ position, the chance of avoiding it would have been 50%.
‘It’s not about being unlucky, but maybe I stepped on poop.’
Life flashed in Lucas’ eyes. It’s not a lucrative business, but shouldn’t you pay the balance? His twin swords vibrated as he gazed at Shirone.
* * *
Ethella was somewhere in the mountains, 800 meters from the impassable bridge. And in front of her was Arcane, who had risen to the rank of an unofficial third-class wizard 40 years ago.
From Arcane’s point of view, he was an unwelcome guest. Even though he was resting, while casting Abyss Nova, his exhausted mental strength was only restored to about 60%.
But that thought was short-lived. Arcane realized the true value of the woman who stood in her way and narrowed her eyes.
‘Oh, look at this?’
He wore oversized goggles. His breasts were also voluptuous, giving him the appearance of a meek sheep that seemed unlikely to know about combat.
But I felt it through my skin. Even though he was just standing, all the energy that penetrated his body was unblocked.
Especially her eyes were the highlight. Through her pupils, the spirit of a sage that could only be given out by those who had transcended the Eight Spirits of joy, sorrow, courtship, and five desires was gushing out.
was a seeker
That’s too good to be a teacher at a magic school.
‘It’s worth destroying Abyss Nova.’
Ethella was equally nervous in front of an authority on dark magic who made her name known as the Archmage before she was even born.
“I’ve heard the famous name well.”
“Where is the Priory?”
Without hearing it, Arcane guessed that Ethella was a monk. However, the answer that followed far exceeded his expectations.
“My name is Ethella, Bishop of the Karsis Monastery. Why is someone who was famous for his dark magic doing such a terrible thing?”
“It’s Bishop.”
Arcane burst into laughter as if it were absurd. To hold the position of bishop at the age of less than thirty was impossible in his heyday.
In particular, if it was Carsis, it was one of the few religious orders on the continent with 2,000 parishes. And a bishop was in charge of one parish, equivalent to the headman of at least one city.
“Where is Alpheas?”
Ethella remained silent. She doesn’t know where she is either, but even that could be information to her enemies.
“I can hear the head rolling from here. To be honest, it doesn’t matter. I didn’t think that that cunning kid would fall prey to my magic.”
Just looking at Alpheas, who had passed the age of 60, calling him a cunning child, he could feel how long the archmage standing in front of him had lived.
“Why are you looking for the principal? If it’s Eun-Won’s relationship, I think it’s doable to meet and solve it in person. If you free the students from mind control and step away, I can arrange a place for you.”
“Chuck! The kid must have built up a pretty good reputation while I was gone. But, child, Alpheas is not the kind of human you think. He is the stupidest and most arrogant guy in the world.”
“It doesn’t matter what the past is. The current principal is a person who is respected by the students.”
“Oh, you mean that?”
Arcane stroked his chin playfully. After all, the Alpheas in his memory was limited to a kid in his 20s who was in the middle of his youth.
“You are curious. What the hell did that kid do to get respect? Let’s listen to what you say.”
Ethella grasped Arcane’s strategy. It was now time for the sun to set. It was a trick to delay time until the night when dark magic was most effective.
“If you are waiting for darkness, stop. As a teacher, I cannot stand by any more evildoing.”
“what?”
Arcane frowned as if in displeasure. She’s 120 years younger than a child, how dare she treat herself as a time-consuming wizard.
As he cast the power of darkness, the arcane’s shadow engulfed the trees. The branches swayed and the trunk began to bend toward a point.
“Did you think I was frightened by you just because the sun came up? If that’s the case, you’re looking at this Arcane very lightly.”
Ethella looked up. Trees in a radius of several hundred meters tilted in unison, rescuing a huge dome entangled like a net. As the sky closed, the son-in-law became darker than the night.
“die. A shameful thing.”
Arcane shuddered into his own shadow and went out. It was a dark pot, a specialty of dark magic. By using the property of assimilation with darkness to erase the concept of distance, it was possible to move anywhere in the shadows in an instant.
Being able to approach without even a presence was the greatest strength of the Dark Fort. The moment Arcane, who overpowered the tail, cast the power of darkness, Ethella’s body turned into a flash of light and moved away. Dozens of shadow hands clawed the air.
A high-speed battle unfolded, starting with Arcane casting Dark Pot again. It was as if there were dozens of Arcanes and Ethellas. When Arcane drove Ethella into a narrow radius, Ethella connected teleportation at extreme speed while standing. Her shadowy hands pierced the insubstantial afterimage as her torso seemed to overlap countlessly.
‘Bishop of the Karsis Monastery. Indeed, it’s quite right.’
Even Arcane, who was harboring anger, couldn’t help but admire. His mental enormity fell short of him, but his skills and senses far exceeded his age.
“Then you should stab the weak part.”
Ethella’s eyes wavered in bewilderment. As the power of darkness intensified, thousands of hands were flying at the same time.
Magical power that can’t be known.
Jonah’s search ability could be called magic in itself, but even so, he couldn’t avoid all the thousands of hands.
As the shadow of the tree branch grabbed her wrist, Ethella hurriedly stopped. Teleporting while in this state will result in your arm being ripped off.
“Oooh… … !”
The tension of the shadow was tough like rubber. However, Ethella’s physical strength was also formidable. She gritted her teeth and tugged at her arm, causing the shadow’s midsection to crack and tear open.
‘Do you have chess? He’s a strong kid.’
Arcane said with a fishy smile.
“If that’s what you like, I’ll make it fit for you.”

===============================
[82] Wizard’s Battle (3)
Feeling alive, Ethella looked around. A shadow leaped from the darkness of the air at breakneck speed and hit her chin.
‘fist?’
Then dozens of shadow fists flew in. Ethella crouched down and covered his vitals with both arms. Even in the midst of the dull sound of blows echoing through the mountains, he did not budge as if he had been rooted.
‘Hoo? Can you survive this?’
Anyone else would have broken bones all over the body. However, Ethella’s eyes through the guards were still clear.
“I admit my toughness, but let’s stop it.”
Shadow hands appeared from all sides and grabbed Ethella in a groggy state. Her limbs stretched out as the power of darkness gripped her wrists and ankles. Her oversized glasses were cracked and tilted, and blood was dripping from her lips.
Arcane cast Poison Cutter. It was a triple mix magic that was much more difficult than fusion magic as it imparted toxicity to the rotating darkness.
Magic, sharp like a blade, rushed through the air. Sensing that it was an instant death technique, Ethella cut off the shadow with all her might, then took a deep breath and let out a noise.
Aaaaaaaaaaa!
The high-frequency roar of the high-pitched roar as it slashed down the bush shattered the darkness of Arcane like smoke.
It was the shout of perm, a monk’s skill.
Karsis Jung, the ancestor of the Karsis Monastery, said early on that the awakening that awakens the human spirit comes with a roar. The roar of the wave was a roaring sound that broke the evil magic. It was the same reason that a human being who had sinned was startled by the sound of thunder.
Buried in the roar, Arcane shuddered. Her skin tingled and her hair stood on end. A woman in her mid-twenties could utter the shout of perm, which she had never seen before in her 130-year life.
‘Hehe, that’s why I can’t leave this floor.’
The best talent polishes one ability to the limit and wields a refined mind like a master sword.
What a fun thing.
Some will die, some will survive.
Isn’t magic developing through countless destruction, creation, and regeneration?
‘That’s it. It’s okay.’
Arcane recast Poison Cutter. Ethella, who decided that it was now or had no chance, cut off the power of darkness that was holding her back and cast space movement. At the same time as the flash of light flew away, the poison cutter pierced the afterimage of light.
“Whew.”
Arcane blew a whistle. The stronger the human being, the greater the sense of humiliation when running away. However, his ability to retreat without hesitation was also important in battle.
Arcane headed to the place where Ethella was standing. She was dripping with blood as if she hadn’t completely avoided it. If she had been poisoned, she wouldn’t have gotten very far.
“The tomboy girl must be having a hard time waking up.”
Arcane, who met a strong enemy after 40 years, was happy. I saw a genius who had all the trinity, including Jonah’s Spirit Zone, martial arts that cut off the power of darkness, and the supreme spirit of a monk.
‘Did I say he was a certified 6th level wizard?’
It is clear that he has a high rank for his age. However, they are geniuses because they are not accepted by social standards. If she hadn’t been bound by her mission as a teacher or seeker, Ethella’s current rank would have been much higher.
“Mirhi Alfeas. That kid gets respect?”
Arcane looked up with sad eyes. As her mind control was released, the trees straightened out, revealing a darkening sky.
“Aren’t you ashamed, Alfeas? To be respected by people who are superior to you. What a cruel reality this is.”
Lamenting the disciple’s incompetence, Arcane moved slowly. The darkness in the forest showed him the way he should go.
* * *
‘damn! Where the hell are you?’
Thaad became more and more anxious. Alpheas was not in the lodging that he was sure would be there. However, if the enemy did not capture it, there was only one place left.
“Master!”
I opened the door to the principal’s office and entered. But even here, Alpheas was nowhere to be seen.
Thaad did not give up and looked at the books displayed on the bookshelf. I knew for a long time that Alpheas had a personal space here.
‘There must be an engine device. I can’t go through all the books.’
A book was caught in the fast-moving gaze. The title of the book inserted between the old-fashioned magic books was ‘Seeing the Darkness’. Thaad, who knew his master’s past, was convinced that this was the path directly connected to Alfeas’ memories.
When the top of the book was pulled, the heavy mechanism rotated and the bookshelf split left and right. There was a tunnel cut through the wall and a set of stairs going down.
As Thaad descended the stairs, the tilted book returned and the bookshelf closed. When the iron door was opened, a small room with a crystal lamp appeared. Numerous items were displayed on the old shelves, and it was quaint enough to believe that it was an antique shop.
A portrait of a woman hung on the wall. She wasn’t exceptionally beautiful, but she had a gentle and graceful impression.
‘That’s him… … .’
Thaad stared at the portrait in a state of fascination. What Alpheas said was true. Her eyes seemed to have the power to attract people.
“Who are you?”
Thaad stunned and turned around. Alfeas was sitting on a chair in the corner with his knee on his back. His face was contorted with anger and bewilderment, which was completely different from usual.
“Master! As expected, you are safe!”
“you… … I guess you know me.”
Thaad, who was approaching, stopped. Hearing Alpheas’ words, he was able to guess the situation.
“You seem to have lost your memory.”
Like the other teachers, it was clear that Alpheas was under the spell of Arcane. However, he seemed to have taken action and fled here before completely losing his memory, befitting a certified 4th-class wizard.
Hearing Thaad’s words, Alfeas approached the bronze mirror. And he looked at himself with a serious expression.
“hmm. Have you lost your memory? I thought I had suddenly come to the future again. Anyway, the face of an 18-year-old turned into an old man like this. That’s pretty annoying.”
Thaad’s eyes widened. If he was 18, he would have been blocked for about 40 years. If Alfeas hadn’t been an extremely rational person, he might have already gone mad.
“Yeah, I lost my memory… … . I’m rather glad Didn’t you steal your life? Where are you anyway? What happened to me to lose my memory?”
“A wizard cast dark magic to harm Master. Master barely escaped.”
Talking to someone who has lost their memory would only increase their anxiety, but Alpheas didn’t care.
“okay? How old am I now?”
“Ah, sixty-three.”
“Sixty-three. Then what have I become?”
“yes?”
“I’m asking what kind of magical achievements you’ve achieved.”
“Ah, as a person of great character, he is currently serving as the principal of a magic school.”
Alpheas made an absurd expression. A genius called the light of the Mirhi family is teaching others. Considering his own personality, this could hardly have happened.
“So what, do you mean I became a teacher?”
“yes. Everyone follows and respects Master.”
“Puhahahaha! Fuhahahaha!”
Alpheas let out a mad laugh. At first, he was annoyed by his sudden aging, but he didn’t care after learning that he had lost his memory. Rather, he was thrilled at the thought of hearing about his achievements from now on.
“Looks like I’ve matured quite a bit too. be the principal Then, is this the royal palace? Has the prince inherited the throne?”
Thaad became anxious. No matter how rational Alpheas was, the gap that had transcended 40 years of time was not something that could be ignored.
“This is a private school. This is the Alpheas Magic School founded by Master himself.”
“Private?”
Alpheas’s expression crumpled. If it was Alpheas of genius thinking, at least the royal family should have been teaching. But is it private? What the hell happened in 40 years of life?
“… … What level am I?”
“yes? Oh, that’s over there… … .”
Thaad hesitated. Numerous records prove how great Alpheas was in his youth. In such a yard, I did not have the courage to honestly inform the reality.
“Tell me quickly! How many classes! Did I say my age is sixty-three? If so, is it level 1? Or second grade?”
Thaad said, lowering his head like a man guilty of a mortal sin.
“Level 4… … .”
Alpheas stumbled. The shock was too great for his aging body to handle. However, he could not control his burning anger and ran rampant on his way.
“What the hell have you done! dumbass! Poor child!”
Alpheas hit his head and blamed himself. He was a god-given talent, and if he had given 40 years, he should have been at least second class. But he’s not even 3rd grade, he’s 4th grade.
What the hell happened? How stupid have I been living to get to this point?
You need to know the past. everything from one to ten. Alfeas, who made up his mind, glared at Thaad and said.
“Can you solve dark magic? You said you were my disciple, so you must have mastered photon magic, right?”
“yes. I don’t know how long it will take, but with Master’s help, it will be possible. but… … .”
Thaad suddenly realized.
Maybe this is not a curse but a blessing?
Because of a mistake he made when he was young, Alpheas has lived with guilt for 40 years. If losing his memory could clear up his past, his lifelong regrets would disappear.
“Master, do you really need to retrieve your memory?”
“what? What are you talking about? It’s my memory, so of course I have to get it back. Something went wrong. If you fix that, you can enter a higher realm even now.”
“Master. You may not understand the current situation. The light of the Mirhi family, which was said to be a gift from God, is only in the official 4th grade principal position. But that’s why I want to dry it even more. Master made a big mistake. And he lived with bitterness for forty years. Now is the time to be free. Maybe this is a divine indulgence?”
Although Alfeas has returned to the age of 18, he knows how painful life can be from the wounds of the past. Also, if it really happened, it was one way to admit it and live like this.
Alpheas, who was lost in thought while wandering around the room, suddenly found a portrait hanging on the wall and asked.
“Who is that woman? Isn’t this my room?”
“Master’s room is correct.”
“okay? Did I hang that picture? She’s not even a beauty, why are her eyes so blurry? She is like a woman who is missing something.”
Thaad was emotionally charged. Since she knew what kind of person Alfeas was, she couldn’t control her sadness.
‘Master, you can’t say that. That one… … .’
Alpheas looked away from the painting with an annoyed face. It was this and that, and there was nothing that made sense.
“I will bring back my memory. The future is too out of line with my plans. I need to know what happened.”
“Master, please reconsider. What is life… … .”
“Hey, you.”
Alpheas raised his arrogant eyes and cut Thaad off. Thaad realized that there was no lie in what the teacher said. That figure was the young Alfeas.
“Did you say you were my disciple?”
“That’s right. It is an undeserved honor for me, and I am always grateful.”
“Then, it’s an excommunication from today.”
“yes?”
Alpheas was sincere. It is the Alfeas of the world. It was the crystallization of intelligence that did not blink an eye even after losing 40 years of memory.
“What’s the point of recovering memories that have passed away? I don’t need a pathetic disciple like you.”

[83] Wizard’s Battle (4)
“I am saying this because it is not. Doesn’t Master know?”
Even if he regains his memories, there is no guarantee that he will return to the old Alpheas. Because living the same life twice doesn’t always mean the same destination.
“no. My judgment is always right. So no matter what form I change, it is only me. It’s your last chance. Cast photonization magic.”
Thaad sighed and nodded. Now, he could only hope that Alfeas’ nature would restore his original personality.
“All right. Then please sit here.”
Thaad brought a chair in the corner and sat Alfeas down.
“let’s begin. I will cast photonization magic, but from then on, it’s up to Master.”
“haha! Are you a bitch who cares about my share? Don’t worry unnecessarily, just do it quickly. If you get your memory back, I’ll give you a big scolding.”
Thaad cast a spell with earnest desire. As the light penetrated the Abyss Nova, a bit of drowsiness came over me. Alpheas slowly closed his eyes and lost himself in thought. Time, which had stopped at the age of 18, began to flow again.
Light and darkness, good and evil (1)
Buried in the bushes, Canis couldn’t lift a finger while the shockwave spread across her abdomen.
After realizing that Arin had a talent for telepathy, he intensively trained in dark physical magic.
Absorbing power was also physical power, and as such, the amount of shock absorption of the dark skin he cast was quite high. Even the hammer wielded by an adult was no more than a child’s punch in front of Dark Skin.
However, the power of the photon cannon that was taken by surprise was a destructive power that far exceeded expectations. Above all, it was impossible to analyze how light could contain physical force.
“Kikiki. You got it right, Canis.”
A muffled voice tickled my ears. No one could be seen on the mountain except Canis, but the voice was real.
“Harvey… … . What happened to me?”
“I don’t know. But what I feel is the mass. The mass, which flew at great speed, was lodged in the abdomen.”
“mass? Light has no mass.”
Since studying the properties of opposites is the basis of a battle mage, Canis also knew about the theory of photonization.
“Of course, light has no mass. But there is energy.”
In fact, photons in motion have an infinitesimal amount of mass. This is called kinetic mass, and a typical example is the solar wind.
“But that’s just a mathematical reduction. It’s like being hit by a club when a strong wind blows.”
“There is a point in what you said. But theoretically it’s possible. Then it is not impossible at all.”
“No, something is missing. To produce this much power, there must be something that connects mass and energy. But there is no such thing in the world.”
Harvey’s voice said plaintively.
“See if you found him.”
Canis didn’t respond. He and Harvey are distinctly different entities, but they also share thoughts. Harvey reluctantly admits that he must have read Canis’s displeasure.
“He’s a great guy. he’s a unique guy There must have been such talent at the magic school.”
Satisfied with that, Canis stood up. Accurately identifying the enemy’s skills was the first button to victory. The first nemesis I met. His body temperature seemed to rise.
“Can you win, Harvey?”
“Quack. Canis, if you want… … .”
A sullen voice penetrated the darkness.
“There’s never been a time we couldn’t win.”
Canis cast an unusually long shadow and returned to the top of the mountain where Shirone was.
* * *
Shirone stared into the darkness of the forest for a long time. She wasn’t sure Canis had cast her darkskin, but the information that didn’t reach her brain and was only etched into her retina was sending her alert signals.
Canis parted through the woods and walked out. Nade frowned as Shirone’s prediction proved correct.
“shit. Are you really fine?”
“Nade. The sun has set.”
At night, the power of dark magic would be maximized, so Eruki cast lighting magic. It was far less bright than Fire Sun, so Nade helped. Two luminaries shone from 10 meters in the sky. However, given that the wizard was moving at high speed, it was still too much to engage in an all-out war.
“Sheesh. Is it still dark?”
At that moment, Canis cast lighting magic. The light magic cast by the dark mage made the two feel uncomfortable.
“What are you thinking? It’s lighting magic.”
“What is it? In any class, photonization theory is a must. It’s the basic principle of teleportation.”
“It’s not like that! Light must be a weakness for a dark mage, right? Why do you want to eat my flesh?”
“ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha!”
Canis burst into laughter.
“As expected, those from the magic school are stupid and stubborn. There is no magic in any class without weaknesses. The important thing is how to make up for your weaknesses. Lighting magic is to prove it. Arin, take another shot.”
As if it wasn’t groundless confidence, Arin, who had a prudent personality, obediently cast lighting magic.
When the four luminaries gathered, the brightness was quite the same as daytime. However, Canis was not satisfied and looked back at Shirone. A magician of light who uses unique powers. With his lighting magic, he could create the stage he wanted.
“Hey, can you shoot me too? I’m looking forward to it.”
Shirone didn’t know how to do lighting magic. While he made technological evolution from teleportation to rainbow drop, from photon output to photon cannon, he didn’t have time to invest in other magic.
“what? can’t you? It’s ridiculous. A wizard of light can’t even cast lighting magic.”
Sometimes it is. There are cases where the magic string stands out in one magic by getting a chance with a short topic. Something like a circus might be quite famous, but magic isn’t stunts, it’s murder. A type like Shirone, who could only do one thing on the battlefield full of all sorts of psychology and tactics, was perfect for dying.
“I was wrong. I thought it would be a good match, but it turned out to be nothing but a kid, right?”
The moment Canis finished speaking, a luminous object popped up above Shirone’s head. The light was bright enough to overshadow the others’ lighting magic.
Nade and Eruki stared blankly at it. I immediately cast the lighting magic I had never learned. His anger preceded the limitless insight.
Shirone strode into Canis’ spirit zone. He couldn’t forgive him for holding all the students hostage and talking about a good confrontation.
“Are you done now? You did what you wanted, so do whatever you want.”
Canis withdrew her earlier thoughts. He is not just a magician who is good at circuses. But does it matter? No matter how strong your opponent is, you are stronger. To prove that, the current situation was perfect.
“anything? You will regret it.”
As he cast the power of darkness, the shadow under his feet rushed towards Shirone like a torrent. After flying up into the sky, Shirone floated a photon on her palm. He thought he could do something great, but it was the same attack as the pattern so far.
‘Are you making me angry just to brag?’
As Shirone cast the photon cannon, Canis’ body shuddered and disappeared under the shadows. This one was a bit new, but it was just a movement magic learned from a book anyway. As they bombarded Canis, who appeared from all sides like a mole, the top of the mountain was razed to the ground.
‘Got it!’
After strategically analyzing Canis’ movement, Shirone fired a predictive shot where it could not be avoided. Canis appeared belatedly where the Photon Cannon fell. impossible to evade. In addition, it was a powerful force that could not be blocked even with dark skin.
Just when everyone thought it was over, a shadow stood up from under Canis’ feet. It looked like an elongated human shadow, and it received photon cannons in both hands and stomach. Photons caught between the palms were absorbed into the shadows with a pop.
Embarrassed, Shirone landed on the ground. The shadow destroyed the photon cannon. It meant that the darkness soon overpowered the light.
“Kikiki, a splendid appearance. How was I?”
“How can that be? The darkness swallows the light… … .”
Nade couldn’t believe it. No matter how strong the dark power was, he could not subdue the light. How would you feel if you lit a torch and your surroundings didn’t light up at all?
The monster body connected to Canis’s shadow did not interfere with its actions at all even while the lighting magic illuminated the ground.
While her face was small, her shoulders and chest were huge. Her waist was as thin as a tiger, and her arms were as long as those of a monkey. His palms were as broad as shields, and his fingers were as thin and long as blades. The fact that the body balance felt beautiful was proof that it was an artificial creation.
“Hey, didn’t I say it wasn’t a big deal? Hey, baby. The photons you shot tasted really good.”
When the shadow spoke, Shirone was speechless. In addition, the fact that he used the expression photon, not light, meant that he had intellectual abilities.
Canis introduced her own shadow.
“Essence of Dark Magic. He is the strongest magic creature harvester.”
“A magical creature?”
The essence of magic biology, a combination of alchemy and magic engineering. It was truly bizarre to see in real life what I had only seen in books. Moreover, it was an intelligent creature that had never been introduced in any book.
“Kikiki! Is that guy completely out of his mind? Why are you like this, like a villager seeing a magical creature for the first time?”
Harvest, who showed off his bold talk, shook his shoulders and laughed. Is it a frivolous, eccentric monster? No, it was an extremely human yet transcendent creature.
“Harvest is immune to light. It is also connected to my life. Unless I die, Harvey will not perish either.”
“Gorum, gorum! We are two and one! One and two! Of course, I have a more handsome face. Because it’s real! He’s so handsome, but there’s no way to show it. Kehehehe!”
Harvest joked, but Shirone had no time to pay attention to it. If it was immune to light, even the dark mage’s only shortcoming was gone.
‘I… … Can I win?’
So far, the location of Alpheas was not clear, let alone help from outsiders. After all, hundreds of lives were in the hands of those present here.
Canis was satisfied with Shirone’s flustered appearance. The effect of introducing Harvest after lighting magic was excellent. This was also Harvest’s strategy. The frivolous tone and attitude are perfect acting. In fact, Harvest was more intelligent than Canis. This is because he transferred all of Arcane’s knowledge. Even at this moment, Harvest was constantly exchanging brainwave patterns with Canis.
– Canis. Let’s go into the forest. We are at a disadvantage here.
– Can you follow me easily?
– It’s urgent over there. Besides, Lucas is quite strong. If we make him move, our side’s power will increase.
– I don’t like it. I don’t want to receive help from a child like that. If you hadn’t stopped it earlier, we would have had a fight.
– It’s for you, Canis. He’s strong and he’s not stupid. He is pushing you when you look at the total amount of figures alone. I can’t let you get caught up in a draining emotional battle.
Lucas was another face of the villains who harassed Canis in Radum. The thought that he needed help from such a person made his insides boil.
– Canis. Heart rate increased by 1.7 times. Increased adrenaline levels impair your judgment. I apologize if I offended you for what I said.
The consideration of the magical creature to prevent loss of combat power calmed Canis’ heart. As long as there was a cold and sober Harvest, he was confident that he would not lose to anyone.
– No, Harvey. Sorry. You are right. Let’s begin.

[84] Light and darkness, good and evil (2)
Clearing her thoughts, Canis glared at Shirone. He was twisted at his smooth appearance, as if he had never suffered.
‘joy. You’ll think I’m a villain but… … .’
The power of darkness rose from the shadow of Canis. Even though it was cut down by the lighting magic, the speed of regeneration was amazing.
‘To me, all of you are evil!’
As the power of darkness rushed forward, Shirone wiped the ground clean with photon output. Then he picked up the photon cannon mounted in his right hand and threw it. Harvest intercepted and received it with his body. As the photon cannon burrowed into the body, Harvest’s body was pushed into the forest. However, far from being shocked, he provoked Shirone by flicking his long fingers.
“Quack. Come in, come in.”
The forest is like a home ground for the dark mage, but Shirone rushed into the forest without delay. Then he fired dozens of photons from left to right and right to left over her head.
Doo doo doo doo! Doo doo doo doo!
Hundreds of flares pierced the ceiling of the forest. Nade and Eruki stared at the sky, which had brightened like daylight, in dismay.
“That bastard, it’s triggered properly.”
“I guess you know that too. If Shirone can’t stop him, it’s a losing game in the end.”
Eruki slowly looked away. Lucas was following Shirone into the forest. Noticing gray smoke billowing in front of his eyes, he quickly threw himself away. The atomic bomb exploded with a bang, and Lucas, who stepped back 10 meters in an instant, glared at Eruki with terrifying eyes.
“You child… … .”
“Don’t do anything stupid. Because what you think, we think too. Just stand there.”
“That’s ridiculous.”
No matter how immature it is, to think that a wizard trainee or something like that would deal with a B-class criminal. When Lucas drew his twin swords, there was a gurgling sound. His temperament conveyed through the spirit zone was haze like burning firewood.
The range of bodies that can be strengthened with schema is infinite, but most of them use proven builds because unbalanced causes serious side effects.
A build that leans to one side will ruin the body. For example, if you put too much strain on the nervous system, the muscle can’t keep up with the speed of the nerve and burst.
The build currently used by Lucas is a mitochondrial build, which instantly increases energy efficiency by strengthening mitochondria, the energy factories of organisms.
Although it has the disadvantage of rapidly consuming stamina, the effect of simultaneously increasing the overall body was attractive, so it was the default build for most users.
‘It could be dangerous… … .’
Eruki checked Nade’s condition. Looking at Lucas with cold eyes reminded me of the summer five years ago. On a day when it rained heavily, the two collided. It was close to a miracle that Nade could laugh now. Perhaps he will never show his old face again. He hated the face that resembled the person he loved the most in the world.
“Careful, Nade. That guy is a schema user.”
“I know. Let’s increase the firepower and suppress them in the early stages.”
Lucas was dumbfounded. The word caution is used when avoiding a puddle or crossing a precarious bridge, not when a knife will sooner or later cut your throat.
“ha. Kids these days… … .”
Lucas, who was scratching his head, blurted out. At the same time, a golden flash was born between Nade and Eruki. The teleportation light flashed and two people appeared ten meters away from Lucas. Eruki looked at his chest. His clothes were cut sharply, and blood was leaking from the line drawn on his chest.
“are you okay?”
“It is not fatal. But it’s really fast.”
Even if magic was a transcendent power, the body of a wizard was definitely human. Excluding the magic effect, the ability to react and respond to the movement of the schema inspection was inevitably reduced.
However, if you think about it backwards, it was the same for the prosecutor. The power of magic is not something that can be endured with a schema. Even with student-level magic, if you allowed correct hits, you would lose your life.
Nade and Eruki concentrated their firepower. Atomic Bomb’s chain of explosions continued like a snake, and Nade calculated Lucas’ movement and fired a predictive shot. However, he couldn’t get a hit on a movement that was completely different from the mechanical patterns he had been training at school.
‘shit! There are quite a few young ones?’
The situation was not easy for Lucas. Due to the nature of the mitochondrial build, his stamina was dropping in seconds. When the energy metabolic rate was raised to the maximum, the speed jumped. Detouring the wide radius in an instant, he jumped up from Eruki’s side and brandished his twin swords. Nade, who ran from the other side, held out both of his hands. As the electric shock magic hit the abdomen, alternating vibrations shook the body at a speed of 60 times per second.
“Eruki! Now!”
Eruki was already preparing. Gray smoke rose from the stunned Lucas’ face. Watching his detonation reaction right in front of his eyes, Lucas tried to move his body with all his might. As if his muscles had been charred, he had no strength.
‘damn! damn!’
To be in danger of dying against only kids. No, are you really dying? When I was in an unexpected situation, I felt like I lost even the sense of reality.
Eruki was sure it was over. It was not a hasty decision as there was even a detonation reaction. However, the Spirit Zone suddenly disappeared. He started paralyzing his legs before he could figure out the cause. Before he knew it, the shadow of another person was connected beneath his feet. I could tell that it was Arin’s skill even without seeing it.
‘Damn it!’
Lucas fought his way out of the alternating current vibration. He then lunged at Nade, who humiliated him. His anger, which went to the threshold of death, reached an all-time high, and the matter containing his emotions flashed.
“Nade! Run away!”
Nade developed electricity in both hands even when he was affected by the Eye. Lucas opened his twin swords and tried to pass left and right. As the blade cut through the wind, unexpectedly thick pillars of ice surged on either side of Nade.
The twin swords plunged into the ice with a bang. Lucas’ eyes widened in shock. His swordsmanship can split even rocks. However, it was a situation where only one piece of ice could not be cut and was blocked.
A familiar face was reflected in Lucas’ eyes as he slowly turned around. She was the teacher, the woman he had just thrown down a cliff.
“Sensei Siena!”
Nade shouted with a flash of color. But Siena said nothing. She had dry eyes that couldn’t read emotions, and she was only looking at Lucas.
* * *
“ha. ha.”
Ethella’s knees, leaning against the trunk of the tree, were bent as if they were about to collapse at any moment. She was the one who had a long 30-minute chase. Even so, she couldn’t completely outrun Arcane.
‘The poison is spreading. I can’t delay treatment any longer.’
Ethella sat down and tore the waist of her habit. Black blood flowed from the scar that passed over her navel. It was a wound from a poison cutter. She is preventing the poison from spreading by breathing, but it is only a temporary remedy. I had to suck her wounds to get her venom out, but it was an area that her lips couldn’t reach.
Ethella put her hands behind her hips, grabbed the trunk of the tree, and put on the grip. A crunching sound came from his spine as he bent his back as he lowered his head. As the erector spinae muscles lengthened the spine, the hips lifted off the ground and the lower back sharply bent. As I rolled my body into a spiral, my lips finally touched the bottom of his navel.
Ethella pushed out all the toxins that permeated her body through her wounds. Then he filled her lungs with air and sucked through her wounds. The moment the poison drained from her, she felt a burning pain. She frowned between her brows and lifted her head vigorously. As she spat her venom out of her mouth, black blood dripped onto the grass. In an instant, the grass dried up.
Ethella’s face began to come alive again. Taking off her crooked glasses and throwing them on the floor, she wrapped her kimono, which she had just torn, around her fist and bumped into them.
“Whoa. I will live for a while now.”
As the swaying Spirit Zone regained its durability, the surrounding energy was transmitted through synesthesia. Opening her eyes wide, she kicked off the ground and took off. Dozens of black hands rose from the ground as if they were squeezing ink.
‘It’s already here… … .’
Being able to pursue Jonah, an expert in exploration, without a break was to prove how agile the Archmage of Darkness can be when facing darkness.
“Looks like the poison has been removed. The more I look at it, the more I like it.”
Arcane appeared after breaking the veil of darkness. However, Ethella did not have to run away any longer.
“It won’t be easy from now on.”
“Are you in the mood to do it right? Then, let’s enjoy it without hesitation.”
As Ethella pushed power into her fist, the energy of the Yin-Yang Wave Fist filled up. Arcane quickly caught her change. She had completely given up on the Spirit Zone.
Wizards deal with the Spirit Zone, swordsmen deal with the schema. However, the capital trains both at the same time. This is because the significance of a monk’s existence is not to ascend to a high place, but to embrace the world with the broadest heart.
Arcane didn’t like that. If she had focused on one field from the beginning, she would not have known her name on the continent.
‘It’s a pity. Why did a talent who could stand on the top of the world choose composition? It would be foolish to say such a thing to someone who doesn’t even think of going up.’
Arcane reached out and cast a spell. If it was the opponent who used the schema, there was a countermeasure against it.
“Darkness.”
Countless spiders crawled out of the shadows of the forest. The sight of spiders the size of human heads gave me goose bumps.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaa!
However, the true value of the family of darkness began now. A dark golem with a height of more than 3 meters stood up next to Arcane.
His face was buried in his shoulders, his torso and limbs swollen as if wrapped in wool. Her arms were long and her legs short.
Dark Fellowship is a magic that casts shadowy powers that convert 100% of mental power into physical power. It was qualitatively different from the power of darkness that absorbs energy from the outside. It is not immune to light like magical creatures, but at night when the sun has fallen, there was no fighting weapon that would exert more power than this.
“Go, my people.”
It was Dark Spider who opened fire. It was impossible to even figure out how many were moving as the number of them got tangled together.
Ethella swung her jab and bounced the spiders in all directions. Then, when she fired a straight line at the spider’s cluster, she let out a pop and the shadows scattered.
Aaaaa!
The Dark Golem broke through the flying spiders and attacked. Her thick forearms slammed her into the ground as Ethella flailed her body like her flying squirrel. As the ground rippled like a wave, it could not withstand the shock and exploded. Ethella’s face turned pale at the power of her earth magic comparable to that of Rubtion. Since all of the Archmage’s mental power was converted into physical power, her physical strength was beyond imagination.
The golem with both hands on the ground turned its head. Then, drawing an arc with his arms as if wielding a hammer, he attacked again.
bang! bang! bang! bang!
Ethella recklessly retreated in response to a chained attack with both fists swinging like windmills. The ultimate weapon equipped with speed, flexibility and destructive power was the Dark Golem.
Since it was impossible to retreat forever, Ethella stepped on the ground and confronted the Dark Golem after escaping.
Aaaaa!
Ethella jumped into the arms of the dark golem that stood up like a barrier and punched her side.
Phew!
The giant golem staggered. As the equivalent exchange took place, a shock rushed through the mind of the Arcane.

[85] Light and darkness, good and evil (3)
‘haha. Is this a human fist?’
It’s a power that can’t be inferior to magic. Moreover, it didn’t even end with a single shot. Ethella held her breath and threw her fists out in succession. His wrists throbbed every time he hit the heavy darkness, but the impact his opponent received was several times his.
Arcane gritted his teeth and collected his mind. Ethella’s fists are powerful, but the nature of her impact is unique. Instead of destroying the surface, she created a shockwave inside. The problem was the interference caused by overlapping shock waves.
‘It’s a wave series. This is dangerous.’
Aaaaaaa!
At the moment the Dark Golem struggled in pain, Ethella’s eyes shone as she was pouring blows. Taking one more step forward, she struck the golem’s stomach with her palm, creating a massive ripple that caused roughly 400 meddling actions. This meant that a shock wave 400 times stronger than Ethella’s regime exploded inside.
The golem shuddered as if it had swallowed a bomb, and its black body swelled up. It looked like it would explode sooner or later.
“Great!”
Arcane frowned and supported his spirit. If the Spirit Zone is broken, the Dark Golem will collapse. As the golem’s tremors subsided as it wrestled with the shockwave, Ethella bit her lip.
‘Is it not enough? I should have nested it a bit more.’
Yin-Yang Wave Fist is a martial art that uses water waves to create ripples on the opponent’s body, then pushes a powerful wave and explodes it. The downside is that it takes time to reach the peak, but once the final blow is in, the amount of impact is terrifying.
But Arcane persevered. The amount of shock received by the Dark Golem was 400 times greater than that of the Scheme Fist, but the Archmage Arcane’s mental strength did not go unnoticed.
“It’s pretty, kid.”
“The next one won’t end like this. Give up now.”
“Chuck! I guess there’s still power left. I’m so glad that I will warm up properly after a long time.”
When Arcane raised his hand, all the Dark Spiders began to permeate into the Dark Golem’s body. The dark golem, which gradually grew in size, finally pierced the ceiling of the sea of water that covered the sky.
Ethella was dizzy. The Dark Golem now visible was the infamous identity of Arcane’s confrontation with numerous nations. A small to medium-sized city could be wiped out in a matter of days.
“How is it, is it nice? Whether it’s a wave ticket or something, you have to beat it hard. The abyss of my golem is deeper than the sea.”
If it was a giant golem over 10 meters tall, it was questionable whether the shockwave could spread. But Ethella clenched his fists enough to crumble. will be the light of the world Even if death awaited him, he had to move on.
Aaaaang!
The Dark Golem walked with a roar. Despite the increase in size, the speed remained the same. Being able to move at the speed of thought was the biggest reason why the Dark Fellowship was classified as overpowered.
thud!
The Dark Golem’s fist hit the place where Ethella was standing. Seismic waves knocked down trees and plowed the ground as if hundreds of moles were passing under it.
thud! thud! thud!
A series of fists were stamped. The shock wave shook the ground and devastated the surroundings. The sixth time the fist landed, Ethella turned her around and climbed onto the golem’s forearm. She then ran up to her shoulders and crossed her arms as she jumped. As she fell, her fast, unseen punch knocked her golem.
Deed deed deed deed!
It was a thunderbolt strike of the Thousand-Handed Kannon, the fifth of the Yin-Yang Wave Fist.
“Big!”
Sparks exploded non-stop in Arcane’s brain. More than 30 shocks per second were pouring in. If the number of ripples generated per second is approximately 300, 600 ripples will spread under the assumption that it takes 2 seconds to land. This alone causes approximately 3,000 interference actions. However, the essence of Yin-Yang Wave Fist was in the final blow, the Jangbeop. What would happen if you allowed it to go there? If all properties of interference, refraction, and reflection are considered, the number of interferences that occur after 2 seconds is quite… … .
‘68,000 times.’
The shock amplified 68,000 times that of Ethella’s blow explodes inside. Arcane’s hair stood on end. However, contrary to her emotions, the corners of her mouth were grotesquely raised.
“Quack! I feel like I’m back now.”
I have no intention of running away. If the enemy was strong, it would have been enough to crush it with more force than that. How much I missed this moment. The glory of the past, where he competed with countless geniuses, passed by like a kaleidoscope.
Aaaaaaa!
The Dark Golem twisted its waist like a pretzel. Ethella, who arrived on the ground, also pulled his hands to his sides. The energy of the thunderbolt field, the last food of the thousand-handed Guanyin thunderbolt, rushed into the palm of my hand. As the Dark Golem’s fist swung forward, Ethella clenched her teeth and held out her two palms.
‘A thunderbolt field!’
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!
A mushroom cloud rose from the middle of the mountain range.
As all the trees in a radius of 20 meters were uprooted, the dense forest turned into a wasteland.
* * *
The stars in the night sky were twinkling. Ethella blinked her eyes in the starlight pouring through the branches.
“… … .”
how much time has passed
No, how far did it fly?
The trees where she flew were all broken.
At the end of the gruesome trail, Ethella, sprawled out, couldn’t move a single finger. Her muscles twitched against her will. There was no feeling at all in her fingertips and toes.
‘Master… … .’
Ethella was incapable of combat.
‘The Archmage is really strong.’
Even the magic of the Yin and Yang Wave Fist wasn’t enough to stop the Dark Fellow cast by the Archmage.
Is this what magic close to disaster is?
The sense of shame at not being able to eradicate evil tormented her heart.
If the waves had been overlapped a little more, if the Thousand-Handed Guanyin had been perfectly mastered, if the power of the thunderbolt had been raised even more.
“Black. Whoa… … .”
Ethella raised her trembling arm and covered her eyes. Hot tears flowed like a waterfall.
“I’m sorry, Master.”
Ethella’s sobs echoed through the mountains.
Group (1)
Shirone and Canis did not miss each other’s position even in the complex terrain of the forest. It was cautious rather than violent, and had a strong tendency toward psychological warfare rather than firefighting. Due to the contrasting nature of light and darkness, if the delicate balance is broken, the charter can turn in an instant. It was a question of who would throw the punch first.
It was Canis who felt the pressure more. Due to the nature of dark magic, they are aiming for counters, but Shirone never gave up a gap and created tension with only tactical movements. Through brainwave exchange, Harvest’s thoughts came over.
– It’s definitely fine. It’s not possible for anyone to be this cool in a combat situation.
– Shall we pretend to be tricked and stick together? You need to create a variable. I can’t be dragged around like this.
– Hmm. It’s a mirror chess situation.
The strategy of moving pieces in the same way as the opponent does not widen the gap in power until the middle. Then, if you can’t stand the pressure and make a mistake, you’ll immediately poke a gap. However, if the opponent maintains the pace until the end, he has no choice but to pay the price for giving the first attack.
‘It doesn’t even show any signs of shaking. If we continue like this, we could end up in danger.’
Canis thought it would be advantageous to take the first attack. And he communicated his will through mental channels.
– Harvey. What do you think?
– huh? Oh yeah. As time goes by, we will be at a disadvantage. let’s go active
When the thoughts coming through the channel were slower than usual, Canis asked, widening the distance with the Dark Fort.
– what’s the matter?
– No, because I felt the seismic waves a while ago. It’s two kilometers from here.
With a highly developed sense of vibration, Harvest was able to see, hear, and even taste through vibration.
– Seismic waves?
– It is still being delivered. Arcane is the only thing that shocks me like this. It’s probably because he cast the Dark Fellowship.
– Master? But the Dark Fellowship is a secret weapon. What does this mean?
– There are good and bad intentions. The good meaning is that the state of inspiration is extremely brisk. The bad meaning is that I met an opponent who was strong enough to cast Dark Fellowship.
– If it’s a strong opponent… … Is it Alpheas?
– For now, it would be reasonable to think so. Anyway, we have to move now. If Arcane found Alpheas, we’d better clean up this place too.
– okay. Let’s begin.
Canis closed the gap and entered. Contrary to expectations, Shirone collided without losing. Catching the change of the flow immediately and maintaining the initiative was an animalistic feedback.
Canis cast the power of darkness. The form of the shadow was endowed with a wizard’s unique personality, and Canis’s was a double-sided saw blade specialized in attack.
As Shirone fired the Photon Cannon continuously, the power of darkness was cut away like a rock stricken by wind and waves. Certainly light was the nemesis of darkness, but Canis adhered to dark magic. All of the basic magic of each series could be used, but it was not at the level of dealing with small skills.
‘Let’s hold on. I can’t use magic of this power forever. If you can endure it, the flow will definitely change.’
As expected by Canis, Shirone’s mental fatigue was accumulating moment by moment. No matter how superior the attribute was, the defense power of dark magic was not negligible.
‘I need more power.’
Since photons are so active, losses inevitably occur. Shirone thus gained mass by compressing the photons faster than they were lost. It was a method that consumed a lot of mental power, but the power was even stronger, and the sphere of white light swayed dizzy and grew in size.
Canis immediately sensed the change.
– what?
– The power has increased. I’ll take it.
Harvest, who blocked Canis’s path, took a posture that gave strength to her abdomen. As a huge photon cannon rammed into the ship, it attacked both of his hands and crushed the photons. However, the photon was not crushed, rather, Harvest’s body flew through the forest with a hollow sound.
Canis’s face turned into an absurd expression.
– Harvey. are you okay?
– so so. It’s terribly heavy. It’s a murder weapon.
Shirone floated a photon cannon above the top of her head. Subsequently, photons were also created on both of his shoulders. As the three photon cannons swayed with enormous mass, Harvest stretched out his arms and shouted as if he would not be pushed back by his momentum.
“Kiki Kiki! It tickles! Is this just your last move?”
“no. Practice for now.”
“… … .”
Harvest’s voice cut off. When the photon cannon, which was twice as powerful as the first shot, was fired, the giant trees in the places where the flash passed by exploded their sides. Harvest’s thoughts flowed as Canis’ mental channel sped up to the limit.
– Canis. let’s avoid this
– Once you start dodging, you’ll lose the initiative. This is a fight you can’t back down from.
– I don’t think I can stop it!
– I can stop it. Absorb my psyche.
– Damn it! You’re a real nuisance, you!
After absorbing Canis’ mental power, Harvest’s body swelled enormously. As the ship opened, the shadow, which had turned into the jaws of a beast, screamed at the three beams.
“Quaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
Light struck the darkness.

Creas is a warm southern city. And now it was summer. However, at the top of the impassable bridge, a snowy blizzard was raging.
Eruki and Nade fastened their collars. The blizzard obscured the view, blurring the images of Siena and Lucas.
“eww. It’s very cold. What happened? Why did Siena-sensei cast magic?”
“Maybe you’ve come back to your senses? He might have awakened when he fell off the cliff.”

[86] Group (2)
“Don’t you think so? What the hell is this magic? not like a teacher At this rate, everyone will freeze to death.”
Nade was equally puzzled. Now there are hundreds of students here. I didn’t think they could survive long in the cold of minus 20 degrees. However, the effect of putting pressure on Lucas was excellent. This is because when the somatic cells are cooled, the mitochondrial build becomes less effective.
“damn! driving me crazy!”
Especially in the place where Lucas was, there was even a strong wind, so the perceived temperature was even lower. Necrosis was progressing from the peripheral nerve.
This was the reason why high-level freezing wizards started fighting with Blizzard by default. Its killing power is not great, but it is a wide range magic and it gives fixed damage called cooling, so it was essential before the great swordsman.
“Anyway, I’m annoyed. Wizards.”
Lucas was fed up with wizards who harassed swordsmen with all kinds of strange magic. But it wasn’t the time to give up. More than anything, she wasn’t just normal in her condition.
As the sharp ice spear flew through the blizzard, Lucas hurriedly threw himself away. However, due to his weakened mitochondrial build, he was unable to dodge completely and grazed his side.
“Damn it!”
Most organisms become less active at low temperatures. In addition, as he braved the cold and swung his sword, his fingertips already had symptoms of erythematous frostbite.
‘I think the temperature has dropped more. Are you really trying to kill them all?’
If the schema users suffered from frostbite, the students should have already frozen to death. But in reality, only Lucas was trapped in Blizzard. Suddenly, a blizzard with a narrower radius was following him, focusing on it.
Lucas, completely unaware of such a fact, bared his teeth at Siena, who appeared through the blizzard.
“Are you crazy? How long will this beggarly blizzard… … .”
Lucas stopped talking. Siena’s eyes still contained nothing. She has no emotions, no thoughts, no ego.
“no way… … .”
Lucas’ shoulders trembled. He remembers magic with his body, not his head.
Literally, the brain.
Just as prosecutors acquire skills through endless repetitive training, they have reached the stage of embodying specific brain wave patterns even in situations where poetry or memory is lost.
repeat, repeat again. After all, he must have driven his spirit to death without rest from the time he was born until now.
‘How long has this woman trained?’
The hair on his head stood on end. Regardless of her skills, the path of Sura she had walked was drawn in her mind.
‘shit! It’s not like stepping on shit, this.’
should get out of here No matter how good the gold coins were, they were just pieces of metal in front of their lives.
Lucas drew all his strength and ran away. If he got out of Blizzard, he wouldn’t be able to catch up. However, his thoughts were delusional, and as a result, he had to pay a heavy price for turning his back on a certified 6th class wizard.
Siena raised a finger and pointed at Lucas, and after a while Lucas screamed and was buried in the snow.
“Quaaaaaa!”
There was no pain. However, the two legs were missing from Schema’s human body diagram, as if they had been cut off with scissors. Lucas twisted his back to examine his legs. I couldn’t feel the slightest sensation in my frozen legs.
‘No, that’s ridiculous.’
It was absolute zero (absolute zero), which had only been heard through rumors.
Freezing magic is a magic that extremely restricts the activity of particles through preservation and condensation, which can be said to be the best battery.
By realizing the realm of Absolute Zero, Siena became a certified 6th-class wizard at the age of only 20.
However, it was a magic that required enormous mental power to the extent that even she could only produce a localized effect.
‘Damn it! It’s a crappy school… … Students, teachers, they are all monsters!’
Siena cast the next spell with a calm expression. It was the advanced magic glacier bombing (glacier bombardment) derived from the battery of preservation condensation. As dozens of huge ice blocks were born in the sky, the blood on Lucas’ face went away. My legs are frozen and there is no way to escape. I have no choice but to surrender my life to the will of Heaven.
Nade and Eruki ran to the students. It wasn’t wide-area magic, but the size of the glacier was so large that I couldn’t be relieved. An almond-shaped chunk of glacier began to fall on top of the students as the ice blocks that froze at different points pushed each other as slowly as their heavy masses.
Nade ran to Arin and grabbed her by the shoulder and knocked her to the floor.
“Kyaaak! what are you doing!”
“Evacuate the students! Otherwise, everyone will die!”
“no! Time is running out!”
Eruki interrupted the two of them and shouted.
“I’ll do it!”
“What are you going to do?”
Eruki gritted his teeth without even having time to answer. Is it really possible? It was a glacier weighing several tens of tons. Even if it was exploded with an atomic bomb, the fragments that were split into dozens were a problem. Calculated by the size of the glacier, it was not a matter of breaking a human head unless it was broken into at least 1,000 pieces.
‘I have no choice but to try… … .’
Momentum can be predicted mathematically. If you calculate all the physical quantities of splitting the glacier, splitting it again, and splitting it again, you should be able to explode it before it crashes.
“Goaaaaaa!”
The Breakaway Spirit Zone dug into the center of the glacier. When the atomic spring exploded through the detonation process of the available limit value, the glacier was excited and split into seven chunks.
Eruki activated Double Spirit Zone. Then, frantically firing Atomic Bombs, the glacier exploded.
Puff puff puff puff puff!
The ice flower is in full bloom. As the glacier burst, it was separated into fragments, which then exploded and scattered like fireworks.
Nade and Arin watched in awe as the chain of explosions unfolded in the sky. Then, realizing the ice pellets were pouring out of the hood, he turned his head to the students. Small fragments fell like hail, but no one was injured.
Arin’s eyes shook in shock. Arcane always disparaged the magic school students. Weak students who take whatever they are given without a spirit of challenge or the will to fight. However, the level of magic school students she experienced herself far exceeded her expectations.
‘This is a magic school. what?’
Arin turned his head. When she realized that she was cradled on the chest of an outsider, she reluctantly pushed Nade away, she screamed.
“go away! what are you doing!”
Nade’s face flushed red as he hit his butt.
“What, what am I! He helped me at best!”
“Why are you helping me! We are enemies!”
“Who said what? Release the mind control quickly! Are you really going to kill all these people? Are you still sane?”
Arin bit his lip. After today, I will be the main character of a massacre that will be recorded in history, but I was not afraid. Had she not met Canis in Radum anyway, she would have been doomed to the brink of misery.
“doesn’t care. If it’s for Canis, even if the whole world dies.”
Nade read the futility and arsenic in Arin’s eyes. What kind of life have you lived to be able to look like this?
“Young car.”
Eruki carried Siena, who had fallen in the snow, on his back. And I turned to Lucas. Does God really exist even for the wicked? He was wedged between glaciers, barely a few meters apart. But he was so angry that his chin was missing and he could only see the whites of his eyes. He lost both legs, so stealing is impossible. In the end, he was the one who would return to the gloomy prison of Inferno after 7 days of jailbreak.
Phew!
Nade and Eruki turned their heads at the roar that erupted from the forest. A thick beam of light soared through the sea of trees.
“wow. What is so big?”
“It’s a photon cannon. Have you ever had an epiphany?”
The forest shuddered, and Shirone came out as if spitting out.
Arin’s face turned red as he looked as if he had just come out of the mud. It was clear that Canis had the victory.
But her expectations were dashed.
As Harvest fell the trees on the left and right with his long arms, Canis limped out. It was more than Shirone’s condition, but by no means less.
Eruki said in disbelief.
“whistle… … is it?”
“Nonsense. Shirone’s photon cannon evolved during battle. Still can’t win?”
Shirone stood up from the ground and said.
“I can’t win.”
Friends doubted their ears. Perhaps it was the first word he had heard since meeting Shirone?
“What, man? Don’t speak weakly.”
“It is not a weak sound. that child… … Really strong.”
Shirone frankly admitted. He would have been more convinced if he knew that he was a disciple of the Archmage, but even if he didn’t know it, he could feel his will in each and every magic.
Willingness not to lose. The will to destroy humans. Willingness to prove that you are the best.
The power of the Photon Cannon was maximized, but Harvest, who borrowed Canis’ spiritual power, absorbed even that.
From then on, it was a brawl. He fought a battle of attrition by exchanging the Power of Darkness and the Photon Cannon.
In the end, Canis successfully countered and pushed Shirone out of the forest.
‘So strong… … Why do you want to harm people?’
If you chose to be evil for whatever reason, you can. Because all humans make mistakes.
However, he could not admit that the evil was strong. Because strength is the product of hard work, not mistakes.
“Why are you doing this? What are you saying the students did to you?”
“Are you kicking it with your mouth because it’s out of power? A typical pattern of weak nobles.”
Since it wasn’t true, Shirone didn’t get angry.
“Answer me. What you are about to do is so terrible that it will go down in history. At least I need to hear the reason.”
“history? Who cares about that? The abandoned are just holding on to live their day. Because if I don’t kill someone, I will die.”
“Don’t try to justify it with sophistry. No matter what kind of life you have lived, there is no one in the world who is not having a hard time. Everyone has to live with the unbearable pain one by one.”
“you. Have you ever eaten feces that fell on the ground?”
Shirone shut his mouth. A cold wind blew.
‘Canis… … .’
Arin’s eyes were filled with sadness. Those who have not lived in Radum will never know what Radum is like.
It was another world separated from the world.
Canis and Arin had been abandoned there. I don’t remember when we were together or why we were the two of us.
However, they were there from the moment they came to their senses, and even while other friends died or were sold, they survived.
Canis was smart from an early age. Even though he was a powerless child, he showed himself how strong a human being can become when his talent and virility meet.
There was only one thing Canis wanted in Radum, which was teeming with villains.
Protecting Arin today.
Women do not exist in Radum. To be precise, she was a woman past infancy.
In places where food is extremely scarce, helpless girls are bound to be eaten as soon as they are born.
However, Arin survived in Radum until the age of ten.
Radum’s only female.
It was Canis who protected the eerie symbol.
He was always barking like a mad dog. When an enemy appears aiming for Arin, he rushes at him with the determination to die.
I couldn’t join any organization with Arin. So he lived by sifting through trash cans day after day.
What’s really funny is that even trash in Radum has an owner. I fought, refusing to tear my flesh to get the dregs that others had discarded.
After such a fierce fight, Canis managed to get half of the moldy bread.

Arin has been starving for the third day. Also, because she starved for 3 days, Canis hadn’t eaten anything for 20 days.
‘omg! omg! I did it! I got it! I got bread!’
Canis frantically ran down the alley. After he had eluded his pursuer, he leaned against the wall and exhaled.
My consciousness was clouded and all I could feel was an empty stomach. I can’t even remember how hungry I was.
A piece of bread caught my eye at that moment.
Canis gulped down her saliva with eyes stained with madness.
I want to eat. I want to put this in my mouth.
‘Yes, I have to work hard for Arin to live. You can eat this much. Arin will be able to hold out for a few more days.’
When I thought about it, it seemed like a really great idea.
Could it be more reasonable than this? Once they eat this, they use their surplus energy to seek food again. Then it will be.
Canis opened her chin and brought the bread to her mouth. Dried saliva leaked out like a flood, and his hands trembled.
“Keugh!”
Canis closed her eyes and put the bread into her arms. It was all lies. What kind of stamina can you get with just this bread?
‘You have to hold on. It doesn’t matter if your body is broken. But if the mind collapses, it’s over.’
Canis looked around like a crazy person. He was thinking of stuffing his stomach with a stone.
He crawled towards the feces someone had thrown at the entrance of the alley. And before he could think of anything, he reached out and stuffed his hand into his mouth.
“Wow! Whoa!”
In the tongue, in the mouth, in the stomach, the whole body was rejecting it. But Canis swallowed it.
better than stone
Poop was better than stone.
After wrestling with her stomach for a long time, Canis returned to her hiding place with a weak gait. She was still upset, but as soon as she saw Arin, she held out the bread with a bright expression.
“Arin, voila! I got this.”
“Oh, is it real? Wow, that’s great.”
“Haha, I know the trick. More will be available in the future. Eat quickly.”
Arin looked at the bread with sad eyes. She wanted to go out to find food together, but she was suicidal to go outside as a woman in Radum.
I had never talked to anyone but Canis. Thanks to this, I developed an antisocial disorder, but would that be a big deal? At least she didn’t become someone’s food and go into the stomach.
“Let’s eat canis too.”
“I’m done. I walked around and ate this and that. There was a big centipede earlier, so I took some nutrition. You can’t eat that, so you should eat this.”
“Because I can eat too. How long will you treat me like a child?”
Canis grabbed Arin’s shoulder with a friendly look.
“Arin, I know. Because you are a courageous child But it shouldn’t be like that. Do you know what I mean? The reason I can survive in this hellish Radum is because I can feed you like a human. If you become like me, you might go crazy. So go ahead and eat.”
It’s something I’ve heard dozens of times. And whenever she said this, it was Arin who always bit the bread pretending not to win.
But this time it was different.
Arin looked at Canis’ mouth with trembling eyes. Something was on it, and it smelled.
“Canis, you… … what did you eat?”
Canis was embarrassed like never before.
“uh? Ahaha! this is a cake The cream fell off and I licked it, but it must have been spilled. Sorry for not talking. I’m so hungry… … !”
match!
Canis’ face turned fierce. She was beaten countless times by things in her back alley, but it was the first time in my life that I had been slapped so painfully.
“Ah, Arin… … .”
Arin was making a scary expression that Canis had never seen before.
“Bad baby… … . How could you do this to me! am i cattle? are you breeding me? You want me to eat this? What the hell am I to you!”
“Arin, it’s not like that! This is my punishment! It has nothing to do with you!”
“I don’t need anything! I don’t need anything like this!”
Arin picked up the bread and threw it away. Looking at the bread rolling in the dust, Canis turned her head away with an angry expression.
“scale! What are you doing! how did i get this… … !”
Arin pulled Canis’ face and kissed him. Tears streamed from her eyes as she licked what was on her lips.
It’s not a sweet kiss. It wasn’t even a beautiful exchange of emotions between humans. Just being born was an act of sympathy between two creatures, sinful in themselves.
Canis only then realized what she had eaten. Tears flowed for the first time since he was born. The sadness he had endured all his life burst out at once.
“Huh! Whoa!”
“Don’t do that again. Just one more time and I can’t be with you anymore.”
“I’m sorry, Arin. Do not leave. you are my only family It’s all the reason I live.”
“okay. Let’s live, Canis. We must live.”
Canis, filled with sadness, could not even answer and nodded in succession. But Arin did not forgive him. That day, until Canis ate an entire piece of bread that fell on the floor.
Canis calmly talked about her past as if she were reciting someone else’s life.
“We lived in hell. But Master saved us there. He gave me something to eat, gave me the strength to protect Arin, and even gave me Harvest, the essence of dark magic.”
People’s eyes turned to Harvest. Normally, it was a talkative magical creature, but this time, it kept its silence.
“okay.”
Shirone said.
“What kind of life have you lived? But that doesn’t justify killing people. Just because you lived harder than others doesn’t mean that bad things become right things.”
“Don’t get me wrong. I’m not defending you, I’m trying to teach you. How thin the justice you believe in, how pretentious the world you live in. What saved Arin and me wasn’t the proud justice you said. I am just doing what I believe in.”
“There is nothing to be gained by hurting people. Your past will never be comforted unless you first try to understand the other person.”
“Kick! consolation? You’re just talking nonsense to the end. Can you tell me the current situation? Master is going to destroy this whole school. It includes your friends.”
“no. you can’t hurt anyone other than yourself.”
As Shirone floated the photon on her hand, Harvest spread her wide palm to cover Canis’ front. But as if that wasn’t enough, she reached out to his arm on the other side and wrapped it around Canis.
“What are you doing, Harvey? There is no need to be so frightened.”
“Dangerous. The temperament is strange.”
Canis snorted. The fight in the forest already confirmed Shirone’s skills. It was a good wood for a magic school student, but even so, it was just a flower in the greenhouse.
“joy. Anyway for me… … .”
Canis’ expression went blank. The photon cannon floating on the palm was vibrating at a terrifying speed. More powerful than the Photon Cannon cast in the forest. However, the degree of his injury was serious to see that he hid his skills.
‘What happened? With this ability… … .’
Canis and Harvest’s analysis is largely correct. However, there was a fact that even they overlooked, and that was that Shirone was an Unlocker who opened the infinite realm.
“This is your last chance. Release the mind control.”
Canis frowned. The fact that he could no longer look down on Shirone hurt his pride.
“Sounds funny. Even if I die, I will follow Master’s will. You cannot break my convictions.”
Shirone’s eyes turned cold. The power of the Photon Cannon, reinforced by the power of the Immortal Function, was on a different level than before.
I don’t want to kill people But if Canis was going to harm the students, he had no choice either.
“Return everyone’s memories. Otherwise… … .”
The photon cannon emitted light as if it were exploding, and then turned into a sphere of cold white light.
“I can’t help but hurt you.”
* * *
The forehead of Thaad, who was casting the photonization magic on Alpheas’s head, was already wet with cold sweat. Viltor Arcane. Although he is an annoying person, the power of the magic he cast was beyond imagination.
‘Whoa. What a powerful mind control. This would work in this day and age, right?’
At first I thought it was easy. No matter how much he was given the title of Archmage, 40 years had passed. Magic evolved several generations and dark magic was weeded out.
However, Abyss Nova was so complex that even Thaad, the beneficiary of advanced magic, could not analyze it.
After 20 minutes, I finally felt the energy of light penetrating into the core of darkness. From then on, Thaad pushed the light with the best mental strength. The curtain of darkness lifted, and Alpheas’ memories began to unfold brilliantly along the flow of light.
* * *
40 years ago. capital Baska.
An unprecedented magic frenzy blew in Tormia Kingdom. The 12th King, Adolf XII, was full of intelligence and a benevolent personality, unlike his predecessors who worshiped military force.
After ascending the throne, he made the magic department, which had been limited to military affairs, independent and attracted numerous talents.
Local as well as talented people from other countries came to Baska to study, and thanks to this, the streets of the capital were overflowing with voices of intelligence every day.
It was a common sight for green wizards who had graduated from magic school to gather in a bar in broad daylight and discuss.
Gypsy-style outfits with primary colors emphasized were in vogue.
For women, hair short enough to reveal the neckline was a symbol of intelligence. The men’s hair, on the other hand, was long to the waist.
At the tavern, a faction was formed due to academic clashes, and it was not uncommon for them to be dragged away by the guards after engaging in a fist fight.
The most famous tavern in Baska was the ‘Home of the Old Gods’, a local tavern.
Over 200 tables in a huge hall. People often went up to the central podium and preached magical views.
All sorts of voices came together and the topics discussed were diverse.
It was the hometown of the ancient gods, where magic disputes were the main focus, but gossip among the nobility was also created in real time.
It was a time of romance.
Alpheas remembered the golden days of his youth like that.
“Oh my, boys! come, come! Alpheas is coming!”
A woman made a fuss at the entrance of the bar, and the women at the table turned to the door with gurgling noises.
“Hello, ladies! It’s noisy here today too!”
Alpheas, a pretty young man with blonde hair up to his waist, has entered the hometown of the ancient gods. A young man with half-shaved hair, which was out of fashion, accompanied him next to him. It was Rian’s grandfather, Ogent Klumph.
The swordsman Klump couldn’t have cast invisibility magic, but the women treated him as invisible and clung to Alfeas.
“I waited, Alfeas-nim! What magic are you going to teach me today?”
“You have to moisten it from the neck first. My tongue hardens quickly if it is not wet.”
“Knock-knock! kid is funny Alpheas is really fun.”
Today’s students would jeer at him, but at the time, Alpheas was a popular person who could say anything.
He was a son of a first-class family, a brilliant graduate who graduated from a magic school, and he had a handsome appearance and sophistication, so wouldn’t there be a woman in the world who would hate him?
On the other hand, the men looked at Alpheas with disapproval. Even people who weren’t narrow-minded enough to be jealous of others didn’t look nice when they evaluated Alpheas, so I could see how much resentment he was getting from men.
The light of the Mirhi family.
At the time, it was an official title for Alpheas, but his nickname was different among those who knew him.
Arrogant Alpheas.

Anyone who has been in the magical world will be able to recognize that Alpheas is a human chosen by God. The problem was that they showed off their talents regardless of time and place.
Once there was an argument, it came to an end, and when the opponent made even a minor mistake, he persistently dug into it and drew recognition.
Only Klump knew that there was no malice in Alpheas’ actions. It is pure rather than arrogant. Passion is too much and people get tired of it.
In fact, Alpheas was the kind of person who would admit his mistakes without hesitation and congratulate his opponent on his victory.
The problem, however, was that this was rarely the case.
Alpheas walked around the table and mingled with people, as if waiting for beer was boring. Klump looked at him worriedly that he might have another accident, but shook his head as if he had no energy to stop it.
“Sarov! Did you come over for a drink in broad daylight?”
Sarov, whom Alpheas welcomed with open arms, was a native of the capital and was one of Alpheas’ few rivals. Although he loses in every argument, the prevailing opinion was that he would be the best prospect in the photon series, if not for Alpheas. Of course, Sarov’s feelings couldn’t be good, but Alfeas approached without hesitation.
“Oh right. Sarov, you submitted your thesis to the royal castle this time? I read it for a while, but it was very interesting.”
“what? Why are you looking at my thesis?”
“Isn’t it obvious? I’m also a photon major, and the royal librarian is my ardent follower. Well done anyway.”
“That, is it? How is it?”
Among the young wizards at the time, the highest value was to work in the Magic Department under the Dragon Lorry in recognition of their dissertation.
Once the thesis was accepted, there was no more honorable position for a wizard because it covered all the expenses for the research as well as the private laboratory.
Since it was Sarov who submitted his lifelong masterpiece a week ago, he couldn’t help but wonder what his rival, Alfeas, would think.
“You pointed out the characteristics of light well. It was spotless. The part about energy concentration honestly felt like a shot.”
Sarov’s expression immediately brightened. However, Alpheas did not just let it go this time.
“But there was one error. It’s the wave nature of light. That is plainly a false theory.”
“What are you talking about? That light is a wave has already been verified through experiments.”
“Yes, but I have a different opinion. If you look at the results of recent experiments, there are too many things that cannot be explained by waves alone. Maybe light is more like a particle.”
“joy! Alpheas, now that I can’t do it, are you even bringing up such gossip? Numerous critics have pointed out errors in the particulate experimentation process! If light is a particle, how can we explain a wave? Those two are completely different concepts!”
Whether light is a particle or a wave was the hottest issue in the era in which Alpheas lived. Although the wave theory was popular, a few scholars were constantly raising objections, and Alpheas was one of those people.
“Do you really believe the critics? I also saw the data that found the error in the particulate experiment process. But it’s not a scientific approach. Could that be the true error?”
Sarov, who was drunk, hit the table and stood up. I was suffering from insomnia because of my thesis, but Alfeas was fanning the house on fire.
“Okay! Who asked you to rate my thesis? If you’re really that confident, why don’t you write it down and see it! Have a good laugh at the world with that nonsense logic!”
“I am saying this out of concern. Even if it falls now, shouldn’t it be reinforced later? Isn’t it important to realize the facts, not the thesis?”
Sarov could not stand it any longer. In the end, what you want to say isn’t ‘you fell this time’?
“go away! I won’t even talk to you from now on!”
Alpheas licked his lips and returned to the table. He didn’t look particularly upset because he thought that arguing with a rival in the same major would be beneficial to both sides.
However, Klump was worried about Alfeas.
The first time we met was at Basuka’s inn. Klump also came to Seoul from Creas, so the students studying abroad were in harmony, and it had been a year since they went together like that.
To be honest, I had no luck. Even if you look at yourself as a prosecutor, but what about the wizards who are your rivals?
“Alpheas, what kind of chicken are you? If others can’t do it, you can just assume that’s the case. Why are you always trying to fix it?”
“Where are you sleeping as a man? What is wrong must be corrected. That is intelligence.”
“I am Do you know what people call you? Arrogant Alfeas. That’s your nickname these days.”
“ha ha ha! is that good? I like it even more than Mirhi’s bright, chicken-inducing nickname.”
Magic is a realm of talent, and Alpheas was endowed with talent to overflowing. No matter how hard he tried to hide it, humility was only a pretense to him who thought that talent shines in the end.
“This, too, is the destiny of a genius. now! Don’t worry too much, let’s have a drink. Hey Raphne. Pay close attention to the snacks. This fellow eats more than bears.”
“Ho-ho-ho! If Alpheas-nim wants it, I’ll give it as much as he wants!”
There was a lot of love in the eyes of Raphne, the bar waiter. Judging from the way she behaved, it seemed that this woman was also infatuated with Alfeas. Alfeas’ attitude toward all women like his lover made Klump’s bones throb.
It wasn’t even that I was in a serious relationship. There were also a lot of men who missed opportunities because they were grabbing hold of women by scratching the surface of watermelons. Even if it wasn’t limited to magic, Alpheas was a public enemy to the men here.
“Rafne-san now? Rather have a proper relationship. What the hell are you thinking?”
“Huh, as you know, I am everyone’s lover. And it’s not even about working. Everything melts in my murderous smile.”
Alpheas touched his chin and smiled. She was definitely a look that women would love madly.
Does laughing like that really work? Klump, who had no connection with women, raised the corner of her mouth as an experiment.
“how is it? If I do this, will I get a killer smile too?”
“Oh yes! Is that a real killer smile? killer smile. Fuhahaha!”
“wanna die?”
“ha ha ha! It’s a joke. Actually, it was pretty close. Make sure to wear that smile at the party later. Because women will fall in love with it.”
“party? Do I have to go there too? I’m not even a wizard.”
Tonight, the Bastard family is holding a party with the theme of Young Wizards’ Night. Although the family had no special relationship with magic, at the time, holding a party under the name of each star was one of the ways to establish the authority of the nobility.
“Is there a way to ask only wizards to come? Everyone from all walks of life will gather, so make some connections. Skills are skills, but connections are also important.”
“It’s kind of funny that those words come out of your mouth.”
“What can I do? First of all, you have to go up high to spread your meaning. Anyway, I beg you to follow me. Do you know if you will find your other half there?”
Klump, who was filled with a desire for the sword, was not interested in personal connections. But at his last words, he couldn’t help but hum.
As Alpheas said, who knows? Will a country prosecutor from the countryside fall in love with a sophisticated city girl?
Klump cleared his throat as if he had suddenly caught a cold.
“Hmmmm! So, where should we go to see?”
* * *
The mansion of Bastard, one of the wealthiest families in the capital, was splendid and splendid, as if it had crossed the borderline of the law that no nobleman’s building should be more luxurious than the royal castle.
300 crystal chandeliers adorned the ceiling of the hall, and tables decorated with gold leaf on marble were generously served with delicacies from all over the world.
To the music of the musicians, nobles danced with their partners, while elderly politicians chatted over wine.
“hello? It’s called Ogent Klump. Did you come alone?”
“Kyaaak!”
Upon seeing Klump, the woman screamed and ran away. How can I not be surprised when a man who looks like a cow thief is wearing a perverted smile? It was literally a killer smile. Klumph froze as if in shock, and Alfeas burst into laughter as he approached and patted his back.
“Puhahaha! Are you really saying that? Oh, it’s a boat.”
“shit! I am an idiot for believing what you said. Anyway, where are you coming from now?”
“Beautiful women talk so much. I came from the other side to talk to you.”
Klump looked at the direction Alpheas pointed. City women of sophistication were glancing at Alfeas, blushing at her.
“Damn it. I think the back of you is more handsome than the front of me. Everyone is looking at you.”
“haha! Never mind. Aren’t they all like that? Since we’re here, let’s eat until we’re full.”
There were many delicacies that could not be seen in the countryside, so it was a car that Klump had been waiting for. Alfeas burst out laughing as he headed to the table thinking that he had to fill his stomach as much as he could without noticing that the women had already become a loner. I liked this simple but positive friend.
While Klump gobbled up the food, Alfeas was sweating dealing with the nobles who came every five minutes. Especially when he personally visited the head of the Bastard family, all the nobles looked at Alfeas.
“Nice to meet you. You are the rising god, Alfeas.”
“I am honored to have recognized you. What a party. Thank you for inviting me to this event.”
“Chuck! It is my pleasure to associate with young intellects. See you often in the future.”
“yes. If you call me, I will gladly attend.”
“okay. Then have fun.”
The conversation was short, but the fact that the head of the Bastard family had more than two words with a wizard who was just starting his social life was a great sign of goodwill.
Alpheas, who turned around in satisfaction, made an absurd expression when he saw Klump frantically stuffing meat into his mouth. It was clear that he was quenching his uncontrollable blood with food.
“Isn’t your chin tired? Where does all that food go?”
Klump munched the meat and pointed at his biceps. Alfeas shook his head and turned around. She felt the stares of many women, but she was bored with him. His lips were purring and he was checking to see if anything interesting was happening when a woman from across the hall caught his eye running between tables.
“huh?”
The first thing that comes to mind is that wizards are definitely not. It was a simple dress, not a gypsy-style outfit, and above all, she refused to wear short hair, a symbol of intelligence, and wore her black hair down to her waist. Seeing them running around with a plate in one hand and a fork in the other, it didn’t match the atmosphere of this place, which emphasizes formality and dignity.
“what? that person Aren’t you the eldest daughter of the head of the family?”
Alpheas, who was intrigued by Klump’s words, asked without taking his eyes off the woman and only slightly turned his head.
“The eldest daughter of the family head?”
“Did you come to the party without knowing that? After all, he’s a guy who can’t be found polite.”
“I don’t know. Okay, so please explain.”
“My name is Bastard Erina. She is 19 years old this year. It can be said that it is the only trouble of the Bastard family.”
“Troublesome? Haha, is it because you have a tomboyish personality?”
“no. A little less intelligent.”
Only then did Alpheas look back at Klump. Perhaps it is true. This bear-like friend I met in Baska wasn’t the type to crack jokes.

“I was in an accident when I was young. So his intellectual age is about 10 years old. How did you come to the party when you said you couldn’t leave the room?”
Alpheas looked back at Erina with a complicated feeling. However, she was greeting her youth with an innocent smile, not caring about the eyes of others on her.
As is often the case at proms, she seemed to be looking for a partner. But no one gave her her good-natured smile. With a rather awkward expression on her face, she was busy avoiding her seat after only saying hello once in a while. Even that was possible because of the authority of the Bastard family.
Alpheas glanced at the cap on the other side of the table. As expected, he was purging his face with his face flushed. Then she couldn’t stand it and shouted at her wife.
“Did I tell you not to bring Erina? Bring it out right now!”
“Honey, hold on. Erina likes to party too. It would be a waste if you try to bring it down and make a fuss. If you leave it alone, I will take it without anyone knowing.”
“Eh! I’m shy. Shame on our family, shame!”
Alpheas pouted his lower lip. I understand how you feel, but it’s a disgrace to her daughter anyway. Of course, I am well aware of the position in society of the first-class nobility. Alpheas was also born into a first-class family and was even given the chilling nickname of Mirhi’s Light.
‘It’s just like looking at my old house. Anyway, nobles.’
Alpheas did not take his eyes off Erina until the music changed three times. What I found out was that she was purely enjoying the party. She seemed satisfied with just the fact that she was greeting people.
But what kind of people are wizards? They were arrogant servants who regarded ignorance as evil. I could see him laughing from the front, but then turning around and mocking Erina, who had fallen less.
“Klump. hold on for a second No, you drink.”
After passing the glass, Alpheas turned to the ballroom, and Klump hurriedly called out to him.
“What else are you going to do? Please don’t make an accident in a place like this.”
“The lesser ones are rejecting the favor of the lady because they learned a little texting. As the most popular person in Basuka, I have to step in and raise her status.”
Klump’s bear-like strength turned Alpheas back.
“Alfeas. you, that’s bad To Erina-san, her sympathy might be taken as a mockery. enough of these people Don’t make her miserable anymore.”
Klump was sincere. The usual dark eyes disappeared, and the eyes glowed with justice. Alpheas smiled and patted Klump on the shoulder.
“Anyway, it’s simple. Do you think I don’t even know that? So far, I’ve never lied to any woman. All sins arise from discrimination. don’t you know this word? If you start caring, her life will become a caged bird. I have thoughts, so leave it to me.”
“Are you serious? are you really going to do it Hey, hey!”
Alfeas, who was crossing the ballroom, looked back at Klump and gave him a killer smile that everyone recognized.
“don’t worry. Because I am everyone’s lover.”
When Alpheas arrived, no one was around Erina. Unknowingly, all of them had left his place. However, she was enjoying her apple without even looking depressed, as if it was her daily life for her.
“hello? It’s a fun ball.”
Erina stopped munching on an apple and blinked while looking back at Alfeas. She could tell just by looking in her eyes that she was less intelligent, before they even spoke.
But it was pure.
It was so pure that it felt like I was projecting the emotions of others like a mirror. Maybe this is her real reason for her people to avoid her, I thought.
“ah! hello! It’s Erina!”
Erina greeted with a bright smile as if she realized something. However, her reaction was definitely different from when she watched from a distance. She seemed to be afraid of something unknown.
‘but. He’ll be the first to talk to you first.’
Alpheas bowed politely and greeted.
“My name is Wizard Mirhi Alfeas. I’m lost in my beauty, so I’m finally here to say hello. If you’ll excuse me, would you be my partner at the prom today?”
Erina blankly opened her chin. A piece of her apple rolled into her mouth. No matter who saw it, the emotion of ‘what happened to this?’ was revealed as it was.
Suddenly, Erina lowered her head. She then, without a word, turned her body and passed Alfeas.
Alpheas was bewildered. To put it simply, the expression ‘it was blacked out’ was accurate. Was it too close to the standard of a normal person? After coming to his senses, he hurriedly threw his body to block Erina’s way.
“Now, wait a minute. Was I in too much of a hurry? sorry. It was because I wanted to get close to Erina-san.”
Erina still had no answer. She was just staring at the ground and stamping her feet to find her way out.
But this time, Alpheas did not give up either. He blocked every corner she was trying to get out of and talked to her incessantly.
“all right. If you don’t like dancing, we’ll talk. Let’s talk. I’ll tell you a very funny story. Are you interested in constellations?”
“I’m going. I want to go into the room Are you scolded by your mother?”
“Why are you scolding your mother? No one scolds you for her. You came to the party, and this is how I apply for a partner.”
“I told you not to tell me. When he talked to me he said he was a bad guy. I want to go into the room.”
Alpheas was frustrated. No, I was nervous. The technique that won the hearts of many women was gone, and the only thought was that he wanted to make eye contact with Erina one more time.
“I am by no means a bad person. Look at my face. How is this the face of a bad person?”
Alpheas grabbed her shoulders with both hands. At the same time, Erina let out her scream as she raised the game.
“Kyaaaagh! no!”
All the nobles in the hall turned to Erina. It was a spectacle of Alpheas committing atrocities no matter who saw it.
“mom! Help me! mom!”
“Erina! look at me! I’m not trying to hurt you!”
“mom! mom!”
Among the wizards invited was Alpheas’s rival, Sarov. While watching Alpheas’ absurd acts, he was speechless. I knew he was crazy, but I never imagined that he would be such an idiot.
“It’s not enough that you grabbed all the Basuka girls, so now you’re even going to seduce a retard? I went crazy because I wanted to succeed.”
Most nobles thought the same. Even if she had less intelligence, she was the eldest daughter of the Bastard family. If she seduced her, her future was the same as mine.
The only person who knew Alfeas’ true feelings was Klumph, but when things got to this point, he let go too.
‘Ah, a psychotic bastard. It’s shit you made, so clean it up.’
Erina was struggling, close to having a seizure. If she was a warm-hearted person, she would let her go in front of her family, but Alpheas clung to her shoulder.
“Erina, wait a minute. look at me See me.”
“mom! Scared, Mom!”
“Erina!”
When Alpheas shouted, Erina’s movements stopped. But a trembling that was much more fearful than before came through.
“Please look at my face just once. I will ask you this.”
Erina slowly turned her head with a terrified expression. I could see the burning eyes of Alpheas. The hot energy was sucked in, and even her heart seemed to heat up.
“Well, how are you? Nothing happens. I’m not a bad person. I won’t do anything if it’s something you don’t like. But it’s a party. Don’t you want to dance?”
Erina’s expression was filled with excitement that could not be hidden. Particles of light breaking on crystals, the sound of music by musicians, and the sounds of many people chatting and chatting. She just wanted to laugh like everyone else.
“Miss Erina. i want to be with you Please be my partner tonight.”
There was no answer, but I had no intention of listening. Alfeas, holding Erina’s hand, walked to the center of the hall. She was toddling like a baby just taking her first steps. And for the first time in her life, she was in the arms of someone other than her family.
As the cunning musicians resumed playing, Alpheas started dancing, leading Erina. The nobles looked stunned. Even her Erina’s parents looked at her speechless.
Alpheas didn’t care. Because Erina doesn’t care. I entrusted my body to the music as if only the two of us existed. It was a dance that was far from dignified. But it was instinctive and passionate. Spinning like a top, he often lost his balance and collided with people. The more she did, the louder her laughter grew. By the time 10 minutes had passed, Erina was able to become the host of the party for the first time.
* * *
Playful laughter echoed through the garden. Alpheas and Erina, who almost ran away from the party and ran away, ran frantically through the forest.
Alpheas, who had reached the end of the garden, stuck out his tongue and breathed heavily. Humiliatingly, Erina didn’t look very tired. She said her stamina was weaker than that of a woman. Thinking of cutting back on her drinking, he looked up at the sky.
It was a night full of stars.
Erina had a surprisingly quiet personality. But according to her words, isn’t she the well-known Alfeas in Baska? She continued the conversation without stopping so that the atmosphere did not have time to cool down.
As time went by, I got the illusion that Erina was telling the story. No matter what topic was brought up, she listened silently. Sometimes, when she smiled as if she understood, Alfeas became more excited and poured out her words like a waterfall.
In the end, the story went beyond the question of the identity of the photon, which has been a concern lately.
Is light a wave or a particle?
Sarov defined it as a wave, but Alfeas was convinced it was wrong. But that didn’t mean advocating granularity either.
To be honest, I don’t know. All I had to do was start by admitting I didn’t know what I didn’t know.
“Isn’t it very rare? Light is a really strange property. Interference experiments reveal wave nature, but on the other hand… … .”
Alpheas stopped talking when he realized that he was too absorbed in his story. Since he was talking so frantically, he didn’t even pay attention to the fact that it was Erina who was listening. She was squatting on her lawn, looking down the garden. But the smile on her lips was still beautiful.
“ha ha ha! Did you talk too much? I think it’s the first time we’ve talked like this for a long time. I usually get tired of it.”
“You are a good person.”
Those were the first words Erina uttered. And Alpheas blinked as if he had heard such a story for the first time. He couldn’t figure out why his heart rate suddenly increased.
My mind was confused.
why am i here What the hell am I expecting from this woman?
It was an unknown world. A world where you can’t judge anything because the desire to enter and the fear coexist.
Alpheas turned away. She went on with her story as if she hadn’t heard her.
“haha! It’s embarrassing, but I have to write a thesis because I’m a wizard, but I don’t know anything about it. I don’t know which way to take the strand. What do you think of Erina? Is light a wave or a particle?”
Erina wasn’t disappointed with Alfeas’ attitude. She stood up from her seat and looked up at the stars floating in the sky.

“Light is beauty.”
“yes? I beg your pardon?”
Alpheas asked. It was natural that he did not know photonics, but this kind of answer was unexpected.
“The light is beautiful. Flowers are beautiful too. We are beautiful too. But the light you speak of… … It doesn’t sound pretty.”
Alpheas felt like he had been hit in the head with a hammer. It was a direct hit in the form of a pure thought that could not be cast into words.
“Yeah, that’s right. But why is light so beautiful?”
To Alpheas, light was just a photon. But Erina, as if she knew everything, answered without hesitation.
“The light shows the darkness. How do we see the night sky without light?”
The world has gone silent. like the universe
Alpheas didn’t say anything. The thoughts he really wanted poured over his head like a waterfall.
Why would you want to differentiate between the two? If you take a step back, you can see it so clearly.
Because it is beautiful.
Any contradiction becomes no contradiction.
“It is beauty. You are so beautiful, Ms. Erina.”
Erina turned her head while smiling innocently like a child. The moment he saw her smile, Alfeas made up his mind.
To remember this moment for the rest of my life.
Alpheas knelt down to Erina. Then, in her most polite gesture, she held out her right hand.
“Please be my light.”
That night 40 years ago.
Confession under the moonlight was a happy memory to Alpheas that could not be exchanged with the rest of the world. A gentle smile appeared on his lips as the Abyss Nova curtain was lifted.
Reversed Master/Servant (1)
Canis glared at the white light burning on Shirone’s palm. It was an overwhelming presence. Of course, he had the belligerence to run towards death without hesitation. He just thought that even if he died, he had to find his money.
– Harvey. I’m on the side of fighting let’s stick
– That magic. How fast? It may not be possible to avoid it.
– You can block it.
– If you can’t stop it, you die. If you die, I will perish too. I’ll have to fight in the end, but there are too many variables.
Exchanging opinions at the speed of thought was a huge advantage in battle. However, there was also a disadvantage of not knowing what kind of judgment to make if opinions were divided into extremes.
“How did this happen?”
It was an unexpected voice that broke the atmosphere of the confrontation. A shadow rushed in from the cliff like water, and a scrawny old man rose to the surface of the darkness.
It was Archmage Arcane.
The impression of Arcane, who grasped the situation at a glance, was crumpled. The reason why he was able to do his best in Ethella was because he was convinced that the situation here had already been sorted out.
Arcane believed in Canis. No, he firmly believed in Harvest, who was subordinate to Canis.
However, when I arrived, the situation was completely different from what I expected.
Lucas is down with a miserable face, and Canis and Harvest are being threatened by a youngster.
“Sorry, Master.”
Arcane was not a generous person. Ignoring Canis’ apology, he turned coldly and glared at Shirone.
‘I heard it looks familiar.’
He resembles Alpheas. Rather than the face or appearance, the temperament felt throughout was similar. It was the same with the spirit of speaking confidently even in the eyes of the archmage.
“Did you plan this?”
“Young people are cheeky. What is your name?”
“I don’t want to tell the murderer his name. Get rid of your mind right now and leave school. Otherwise, I won’t let you go.”
“Heh heh heh.”
Arcane burst out laughing. I wasn’t angry. However, the criterion for him killing someone was not anger, but how much fun he could have. In that sense, Shirone was a ripe fruit that could be cut right away.
“I’m sorry, but I can’t release mind control. Because the disciples of Alpheas must die.”
Sensing a sense of death, Shirone fired the photon cannon without realizing it, with goosebumps all over her body.
It was obviously an accidental shot.
Arcane lightly turned and evaded the photon cannon. And he turned around only after confirming that the magic had dissipated.
“The radius of the Spirit Zone is 52.7 meters. That’s quite right. That’s pretty good for his age.”
Even if it is a photon, the ideal velocity containing mass cannot exceed the scope of the physical world. However, since there is a basic speed of photon output, it was much faster than most flying objects. It was not human sense to evade the photon cannon for an instant and measure the radius of the spirit zone.
Shirone gritted his teeth and compressed the photons again. He met a master whose competence he couldn’t figure out, but he had no choice but to fight to stop hundreds of students from free falling down a cliff.
“Stop it, Shirone.”
Ethella walked out of the mountain. Her clothes were torn, exposing her bare skin, and she was covered in dirt from head to toe.
“Don’t rush into it. Arcane is a dangerous character.”
Arcane’s brow wrinkled. She enjoyed her battles with her, but her food, which had already been trampled and soiled, had long been erased from her memory.
“The loser has a thick face. If you saved your life, you should cherish it.”
Shirone and the others were shocked. Could it be that Miss Ethella was defeated by an old man with only her bones left? Bishop of the Karsis Monastery. Jonah, the authority of the Spirit Zone. Certified 6th class wizard. Her titles that qualifies her are not something she can afford to take care of.
“Nonsense. Teacher Ethella… … .”
Nade wondered if it was possible. Of course, there are 5th and 4th graders in the world, but I couldn’t even imagine what level it was to be stronger than Ethella.
Shirone asked while supporting Ethella.
“Are you okay, sir?”
“so so. But it will take time to recover.”
“What happened? Who is that? Why are you doing this?”
“Viltor Arcane. He’s an archmage who rose to the unofficial level 3 40 years ago.”
The eyes of Shirone and the others wavered. Any magic school student knows what an unofficial 3rd class is like.
The wizard’s grade is classified into 10 levels, but there is a specific section where the honor and achievement points that must be accumulated for promotion jump unimaginably high.
It was the 7th grade to the 6th grade, and the 4th grade to the 3rd grade.
If the 6th grade was the executive level of the wizard society, the 3rd grade was a position that could take the head of the kingdom’s core facilities. Considering that even Alfeas, a certified 4th-class wizard, was the principal of a private school, it was possible to guess how high-ranking a wizard Arcane was.
“Arcane has a grudge against the principal. She won’t back down until she gets what she wants.”
“You talk a lot over and over again. Complaining to your disciple will only make you more miserable.”
“I am not interested in winning. I am a teacher. I will do anything to protect my students.”
“so? What can you do? Do you think you can stop me now, who couldn’t win even if I attacked with all my might?”
“The bluff is too much. Arcane.”
Arcane’s impression changed terribly.
“Obviously I couldn’t stop you. But you also don’t have the mental strength left to focus on battle, right?”
Ethella’s words were half right and half wrong. In fact, the magical power of the Arcane who cast the Dark Family was only 10% of the normal state. However, it was 10% of the Archmage. It was enough power to sweep away the exhausted Ethella and her fluffy youngsters.
“Times have changed. I asked him to come because it was cute, and he didn’t even know the subject and fluttered his snout?”
Arcane raised his magic power. It was 10% left to kill Alpheas, but it didn’t matter. Troublesome calculations did not fit his outlook on life.
“Master, leave it to me.”
Canis interrupted. Abyss Nova is a gigantic magic that consumes so much mental power that ordinary wizards cannot even try. If he cast such magic and went through battle, even Master would not be in a normal state.
Arcane looked back at Canis displeasedly. He could not tolerate challenging authority, even as a disciple. However, after thinking it through, he turned to Shirone with an interesting expression.
“Hey, sweetheart. Are you also a disciple of Alpheas?”
“Don’t call the principal by name, even though he’s a murderer.”
“Kkeukkeuk! Is that so? You seem to respect him quite a bit.”
Shirone didn’t even feel the need to answer. How could she not respect her? Alpheas was the one who opened his eyes to magic and the benefactor who enrolled him, a commoner, in magic school.
“It doesn’t matter if you’re an archmage or a third-class. Compared to the Headmaster, you are not even a wizard.”
“Puhahaha! Fuhahahaha!”
Arcane burst into laughter. But his eyes were burning with anger.
‘Alpheas. How long have you been living under pretense? don’t you know That you don’t deserve to be respected by anyone.’
Having made a decision, Arcane nodded.
“good night. It would be fun to watch the disciples fight. Canis. Contend with him.”
“yes. Thank you, Master.”
Canis finally felt relieved. It was an opportunity for him to make up for the mistakes he had made so far. However, Harvest had a different idea.
– Canis. Think again. Better leave it to Arcane.
– What are you talking about? I’ve already disappointed Master. Now, even if I die, I have to defeat Shirone.
It was never a good thing to have disagreements with each other in a situation where a battle was ahead.
– Harvest. Answer me. No matter how much you are, you can’t give up this much. We will fight unconditionally.
Harvest had no answer until the end. I was embarrassed because I had never been like this before. However, he couldn’t show weakness as long as Arcane was watching.
Using the Dark Fort, he moved to the place where Shirone was in an instant, and Shirone cast teleportation and flew off the cliff. This was to ensure that the students were not affected as much as possible.
“joy! Are we going to have a dogfight?”
If the night sky was covered with darkness, it was not a disadvantageous field for Canis, who moved to the Dark Fort.
On top of a 1,000-meter-high cliff, the two spread their firepower while flying reminiscent of every fight.
Shirone condensed seven photons in front of her and fired them all at once. The Photon Cannon, which was activated in the infinite realm, was several times stronger than before, but the repulsive force was as great as that.
Every time I cast magic, my consciousness went away moment by moment. The infinite realm that threatens the opponent and at the same time collapses one’s own mental power was definitely a double-edged sword.
“What about that… … .”
Ethella blankly looked up at the sky. Her shockwave-generating photon output was something she had never seen before.
A dazzling beam of light from the Photon Cannon split the night sky. It was as if a golden pen was being stroked on a black canvas.
Eruki and Nade were mesmerized by the beam of light. Indiscriminately firing a powerful photon cannon with a single shot was tantamount to weaponizing a human named Shirone.
“It is also great. But would that be okay?”
“I just have to believe it. You did well at the presentation.”
“But it was different from then. It’s a situation where you’re fighting for your life right now. You may cross the line without even realizing it.”
Ethella looked back at the two and asked.
“What do you mean? So you’re saying Shirone has been to Immortal Function before?”
“yes? Oh, that’s true… … These days, it seems like I do it whenever I’m bored.”
Ethella sighed. That she wouldn’t even pretend to be careful when I warned her that her life could be lost. Well, if it wasn’t for that passion, such rapid growth wouldn’t have been possible.

Chapter - 91 - Reversed Master Servant(2) 5.txt
===============================
[91] Reversed Master/Servant (2)
Dodging the flash of the rampaging Photon Cannon, Canis was embarrassed like never before. Why are you not tired? It was as if the limit of mental power had been cut off.
– Harvey! I’ll get it this way!
Harvest still hasn’t received any comments. It was ominous because it had never been like this before. Besides, I couldn’t figure out why. Canis knew best that she was not a magical creature foolish enough to remain silent during battle because she felt bad for a disagreement.
– Harvest! Answer me!
A photon cannon brushed past Canis, who was paying attention to the mental channels. He hurriedly turned his back, but it was obviously a belated response. It wasn’t that it was dodged, it was that it wasn’t hit.
“what?”
About 10 flashes of light were fired from Shirone. But this time, too, the aim was not accurate. Canis finally realized. Numerous flashes of light were extinguishing all the darkness that could travel to the Dark Fort.
‘This crazy… … !’
If he couldn’t hit it, it was a strategy to hold on and defeat him. It makes sense, but isn’t it too ignorant? He had already fired more than 200 shots of mentally consuming magic like the Photon Cannon. Even so, far from getting tired, the number of flashes continued to increase.
‘How big is your mental power?’
The thought gave me goosebumps. As dozens of photon cannons filled Canis’ field of vision, despair filled his heart. A bunch of flashes were coming in, blocking all possible routes to the Dark Fort.
‘This cannot be avoided. It’s over.’
It was angry and cynical. He was more afraid of being defeated by the wizard of light in front of Master than dying.
– That’s annoying. Arcane.
– Harvey?
The dogfight begins and the first mental channel opens. Harvest blocked Canis’ way and received the Photon Cannon with his body. A bizarre groan leaked out as the whole body of the magical creature shook at the shock waves that came in succession.
Thinking that the surface alone could not be absorbed, Harvest opened his body wide and swallowed the Photon Cannon whole. His body trembled, and his waist, which had been said to be as thin as a tiger, inflated like a balloon. His body’s absorption power was fully activated and began to digest the photons. Then he gradually returned to his original form as his body contracted.
“Ouch… … !”
Canis bent her upper body with a shocked expression. The reason Harvest was able to absorb the Photon Cannon was because he used his mental powers. However, arbitrarily borrowing power without approval was impossible due to the master/servant’s contract.
– Harvest?
– Wake up and get ready!
Harvest, who absorbed all of Canis’ mental power, flew to Shirone and brandished his claws. Shirone, not accustomed to close combat, was cornered. Harvest’s speed was nimble enough to catch up with an evasive action by teleportation. How could this be? It seemed even stronger than Canis.
Ethella, who had the same thoughts as Shirone, looked back at Arcane. From the way he watched the battle with emotionless eyes, I could tell the full story of the situation.
‘Viltor Arcane. What a cruel man you are.’
The reason why the best magic creature was attached to Canis wasn’t because he loved his pupil. To him who was burning with his vengeance, disciples were nothing but consumables to fulfill his will. A fuel tank that can maximize the power of Harvest. That was the significance of Canis’ existence.
As Shirone increased the link speed of teleportation, Harvest’s movement became faster. Canis’ complexion turned pale like a corpse’s. He couldn’t even think because his mental strength was drained. Only emotions like betrayal and deprivation echoed in my head.
– Harvest. why?
All that came back was silence. The life in Canis’ eyes died when she realized who was the owner. Tears welled up as everything that had passed passed by like a kaleidoscope.
Shirone took refuge on the ground. He had his blood dripping from his wounds, which had been cut as if cut by a knife.
‘The Photon Cannon doesn’t work either. There’s not much time left to unlock Immortal Functions.’
Canis, who came down with Harvest, put her hands on the ground. The pupils were out of focus. Harvest didn’t care and rushed at Shirone. The battle had to be finished before Canis’ mental strength was exhausted.
Shirone thought while dodging Harvest’s sharp claw attack. The situation that had been winning a moment ago was reversed in an instant.
master-servant reversal.
As Harvest, who was only an assistant to Canis, came to the fore, things began to change. A magical creature that has no fear of death. Could there be a more demanding enemy on the battlefield? The Canisra was a combat weapon that moved while sucking the life out of the fuel tank.
‘Combat weapon… … ?’
Shirone suddenly realized that he was mistaken. She had been obscured by Harvest’s intellect until now. The meaning of the reversal of master and servant was simple. Enemies changed from living to inanimate. Then, of course, magic had to change accordingly.
Revamping her strategy completely, Shirone canceled the photon cannon and cast a photon output. The reason why the Photon Cannon is dangerous is because of the impact force that destroys living things. However, physical force was not important to Harvest, who had no life for him. If it is specialized in absorbing energy, it can be destroyed with energy that exceeds the limit.
Since the photon output is pure magic and does not even have mass, it was more flexible than the Photon Cannon. Moreover, the immortal function was still open. When Shirone’s power, which transmitted light with 100 percent efficiency to 300 hologram devices installed in the school, was concentrated in one place, a beam of light large enough to cover a person’s body was shot.
“Great!”
Harvest was pushed back as if being buried in the light. He had no physical powers, but smoke was rising from his body made of dark matter. However, since he is immune to light, the nature of photons did not help. Only the energy contained in the photons could cut him.
‘I need stronger energy.’
Shirone came up with the formula that energy is the square of the mass and the speed of light, a representative formula of photonization theory. God Particles are batteries that impart mass. Then it was possible to convert mass into energy by reversing the formula of photonization theory.
Cells of photon output were reconstructed based on mass. When combined with the omnipotence of the Immortal Function, mass began to be converted into energy in real time. The pleasure felt when the theory and reality matched perfectly was incomparable to anything else, and Shirone felt a thrill as she took her first step into the unknown world.
“I-what is that?”
The eyes of everyone watching the battle widened. The photon output began to taper off, emitting a blood-red glow. I didn’t know what kind of magic it was, but the color alone was threatening.
Eruki recalled a story about a certain phenomenon of light that he had heard from his father, the leader of the dragon.
“that… … Are you sure it’s not a laser?”
“laser? what is that?”
“The light energy is highly amplified. Could it be called the ultimate evolution of the flash series? But how is that possible?”
Razor was a matter of brute force, not talent or effort. It took at least 10 years of mental rebound to gain enough strength to amplify photons with lasers.
However, if you take a mathematical detour, the story is different. Shirone, who reconstructed the theory of photonization based on divine particles, amplified energy through mass conversion rather than brute force. In other words, the original battery developed a new route.
“Kuaaaaa!”
Harvest struggled in pain. The laser was extremely thin compared to the photon output, but the energy it accumulated was beyond imagination. Color wasn’t a problem from the beginning. The real danger was the invisible heat rays outside the red wavelength. A single-wavelength laser was generating enormous heat as the molecules vibrated.
“Harvest!”
Canis clutched her painful head and screamed. The fact that a huge shock hit the brain meant that the limit of energy that Harvest could absorb had been exceeded in just two seconds. It was the power of Shirone’s new magic laser pulse cannon.
Harvest tried his best to digest the energy, but the molecular vibration speed was too fast. As the amount of absorption reached saturation, it increased in size and eventually inflated like a balloon.
Ethella observed Arcane’s reaction. Seeing that there was no change in expression even in a situation where defeat was dark, I felt uneasy.
“Canis! Stop giving up!”
What’s next for the massively bloated Harvest? It may be annihilation, but it may be a much more terrible ending than that.
“shut up! I will fight!”
“You are being tricked by Arcane. Harvest is not your subordinate. Rather, you were Harvest’s subordinate. Arcane just used you.”
Canis didn’t answer. He’d be lying if he said he wasn’t feeling anything. From the time he heard that the final product of the archmage, the magical creature, would become his, he thought that it might be possible. He just didn’t have the courage to face reality. If he admits the truth, there is nothing left for him.
“I win! I’m not afraid to die! I will never give in to the likes of you!”
When he came to his senses, he was in Radum, which is called the hell of the world. To Arcane, he was just a consumable. To Harvest, whom he considered a friend, he was nothing more than a fuel tank. It didn’t matter anyway. Only the heart that hated the world remained.
‘Canis… … .’
Arin covered his mouth and wept. Canis has always been such a child. She was a poor child who could do nothing for the people she loved but torturing herself.
“Master! Save Canis! please!”
I didn’t even think of being a teacher. Still, he bent over his pride and ej*culated in order to save Canis. However, Arcane only gave orders to Harvest with cold eyes.
“End here. Harvest.”
The energy-saturated Harvest couldn’t answer. He was about to explode, making a sound with vibration. And that was the result Arcane wanted.
– Canis. listen carefully.
– Harvest.
– Arcane intends to explode me. Probably everyone in this place will be caught in the explosion. Then you and I are finished.
Arin solved the mental control of the students. And rushed at Arcane, pouring her tears and her snot.
“Save Canis! Otherwise, I will not forgive you!”
“scale!”
said Canis, standing up.
“What are you doing to Master? Stop right now.”
“Canis! This human… … !”
“okay. Master saved us from hell. He said he allowed me to get out of Radum. That’s enough. I will fight to the end.”
Did Canis really mean it? But it didn’t matter now. His anger burned so intensely that he even felt relieved of his own death.
“okay! We will all die together!”
Canis shouted to the sky. Hot tears ran down his cheeks. What a dirty life she was. However, if that is his fate, he will face a disgusting end until the end.
“Quaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
Huge bubbles bubbled through Harvest’s body as the molecules boiled. Now anyone could tell. Arcane was thinking of blowing up the entire school.
“Shirone! stop! Harvest explodes!”
Shirone, who was pouring out energy in a trance, heard Ethella’s words and hurriedly stopped the output. However, a detonation reaction was already underway in Harvest’s body. He foretold that the 2nd and 3rd explosions would occur when he bizarrely twisted the angle.
“Ha ha ha ha ha! bye! You must feel dirty dying with trash like me! I’m going to end everything with this!”
– Canis. sorry.
Canis’ face hardened.
– I will cancel the master-servant contract.
Harvest absorbed all the remaining mental power and canceled the contract. Canis, feeling deprived as if her soul was draining, fell to her floor with her face in shock.
“Uh, why… … Harvey… … .”
Harvest flew into the sky. How many seconds were left before the explosion? 3 seconds? 2 seconds? In the process of running towards the end of life, the memories permeated in the form of vibrations were revived. Harvey. Harvey. Harvey. It was a pity to think that I could no longer hear the voice I used to call out.
‘Quack. Canis. you have that problem Pretending to be strong unnecessarily.’
Since there was no life from the beginning, he was not afraid of death. I was just worried. The sense of betrayal I received through the mental channel was still felt as if we were one body. But since he couldn’t convey anything now, Harvest just hoped.
I hope Canis isn’t hurt too much.
At an altitude of two kilometers above the ground, where voices could not reach, the corners of the mouth of the shadow’s face were grotesquely torn.
“It was fun though. Canis.”
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
There was a huge explosion that destroyed the darkness of the world.

Chapter - 92 - The Genius Who Lost the Light(1).txt
===============================
[92] Genius who lost his light (1)
“Your name is Harvest.”
The black beads vibrated at Arcane’s words. As the molecular bonds loosened, black matter rose into smoke. The monster body born in the darkness spoke in a muddy voice.
“I am a harvestist.”
“We will do some tests. Let him be in the test tube for the time being.”
Arcane pointed to a three-meter-tall glass tube. It was such a small place that humans couldn’t even last 10 minutes, but magical creatures had no concept of the permanence of time.
That night, Canis and Arin infiltrated the laboratory. Since he had not received permission from Arcane, his nervousness was evident. However, that feeling disappeared the moment I discovered Harvest.
A humanoid shadow with a height of 2 meters.
The slender waist and dynamic broad shoulders shook Canis’ heart.
“This is Master’s… … .”
The essence of sorcery biology perfected over 150 years by the Archmage. In addition, it was a magical creature that inherited the memories of Arcane and possessed intelligence.
Unlike Canis, Arin trembled as if he had seen a monster.
“Ugh. It’s very strange. I thought it would be similar to a human.”
“Who’s going to be scared if a magical creature doesn’t look scary? I think this form is really great. You are combative.”
“Still, I am strange… … .”
Canis didn’t care. If she didn’t like her, it was rather a good thing.
‘Wait, Harvest. I’ll be your master.’
Arcane said that she would choose the owner of Harvest between herself and Arin. Of course, Arin is a precious friend, but there was no concession in this matter. We will definitely prove our qualifications through friendly competition.
“Canis, let’s get out. Maybe Master will come.”
“huh? uh, yes.”
Arin turned off the lights and followed behind Canis. Then, startled, she looked back. Harvest’s explosive emotions came through.
“Mom!”
Arin ran out of the room as if running away and did not even go to the lab after that day. However, as a child she was locked up in Radum’s warehouse, she couldn’t leave Harvest alone like this.
While everyone was asleep, Arin mustered up the courage to visit the lab. Harvest was trapped in a glass coffin as before.
“Are you very frustrated?”
When there was no answer, Arin looked for the switch while examining the device in the glass tube.
“I can get you out for a moment.”
“Why do you think it is frustrating?”
Arin took a step back. It was a hoarse voice that evoked fear.
“You’ve been locked up for a month already.”
“It is human beings who are uncomfortable with being unable to move. I can’t perceive time It doesn’t matter if you’re locked up like this forever.”
Arin tilted his head in disbelief. It was because the Harvest wave she felt was filled with suppressed and stuffy energy.
“… … But maybe you’re right.”
“Did you remember something?”
“Well. Should I say curiosity? The expression is not suitable. I am made to learn from the moment I exist. But now that is impossible.”
“That’s what I mean by saying it’s frustrating.”
Harvest was deep in thought. Is it really like that?
“How can you read my emotions?”
“lol. Somehow it happened like this. I lived in Radum for a long time.”
“Radum. The slums of Baska, the capital of Tormia. High-level concealed facilities and extreme population fluctuations. It is presumed to be the den of sub-species who have lost territory on the continent.”
Even Arin, who lived in Radum, had never heard of it.
“Mr. Harvest knows a lot.”
“What information do you have?”
“You want to talk?”
“Right. I have no choice but to have a conversation. I still don’t have a master to share my spirit with.”
Arin talked with Harvest all night long. It was the first time she had ever talked so much with someone of her own, having spent most of her childhood alone.
After two months of experimentation, Harvest was finally set free. Arcane opened the glass coffin. But Harvest still didn’t move.
“Come out. You come into resonance with Canis. But it will not be subject to the constraints of subordination. I will explain the reason later.”
Harvest didn’t answer. It was unexpected that a magical creature with superhuman calculation speed was slow to respond, so Arcane turned his head.
“why? Do you think it will take?”
“Why Canis?”
“Hmm. Do you mean you don’t like it? It’s strange that you, who don’t have mental resonance, already have a taste.”
“I understand that there is no advantage to me being subordinate to you, having inherited your memories. But Canis is stubborn and proud. He’s unlikely to listen to my advice. Such an inclination will be a weakness in battle.”
“Of course not.”
“On the other hand, Arin is different. She lived in Radum for 10 years and never met anyone except Canis. The resulting backlash makes her mental sensitivity incredibly sensitive.”
“Are you talking about menarche?”
Menarche was a unique brain wave pattern that perceived any object as if it were seeing it for the first time. Arin grew up without seeing anything since childhood, and that condition hardened her brain.
So she couldn’t distinguish things like normal people. But she was absolute when it came to grasping the feeling of things. Although she had many inconveniences, she was the best talent for spirit-type wizards.
Arcane knew that Arin’s talent was more special than Canis’.
“Arin can’t. That child is too soft-hearted.”
“I don’t understand. Carbide more than covers other disadvantages. With her, she can maximize my abilities.”
Arcane smiled bitterly.
Are the judgments different because they share the same memories but have different forms?
“Perhaps your words could be more reasonable. But Arin can’t. You are going to Canis.”
* * *
“Quack!”
The falling Harvest shuddered.
“That was it, Arcane.”
I was able to realize it only when I came to the last moment of my life. The reason why Arcane gave up Arin, who had excellent magical talents, and chose Canis.
‘It was the same stubborn.’
Harvest’s fall felt no weight. So he looked even more shabby.
“Harvest!”
Canis ran to Harvest. There were holes in Harvest’s body, shrunken like a thin sheet of paper, so it was hard to see with the naked eye.
“why! why did you do that! I didn’t care if I died! If you’re going to do this, don’t betray me from the start! Why the hell!”
“Quack. how do i know that You are my master.”
Canis, as if realizing something, kept his mouth shut.
“A magical creature, you just have to do what the owner wants.”
“Harvest… … .”
Canis’ head fell. I was resentful and unfair to live, and I would rather die. But at the same time, she wanted to live. why wouldn’t you want to live? that was human Harvest seemed to know. That is why he decided to sever the master-servant contract and self-destruct.
“I’m sorry, Harvest. I am… … .”
Harvest didn’t care. A magical creature can do what its owner wants. Because it was designed that way, death was also not a shocking event. Rather, he was more interested in the fighting power of Shirone, who overpowered Canis and his combination play.
‘Hmm. You use strange magic. But I’m not simply pushed back from magic.’
It was definitely a strong enemy. There is no hesitation in overpowering opponents. However, it was not a warlike personality. Rather, the combat method that was thoroughly focused only on results resembled that of a magical organism.
‘The speed at which emotions are restored is incredibly fast. Perhaps superhuman insight. It seems unshakable because the time from problem to solution is so short.’
After the analysis, Harvest tore his mouth. Absolutely specialized in something. I don’t know what it was, but it wasn’t a property commonly expressed in nature.
‘Quack. Arcane, you’re going to have a hard time.’
Arcane’s expression was not good. He was this guy and that guy, and there was no human being who could move according to his will. Feeling irritated by the current situation, he said as he moved slowly.
“I’m sorry, Canis. Even if you disgrace my face… … .”
“shut up.”
Shirone stopped talking. His friends’ eyes widened at his unusually radical words. Arcane, on the other hand, turned her head in interest. If it was too absurd, he wouldn’t even get angry.
“Chuck! What a lively child. How are you? I’ll make a suggestion… … .”
“I told you to shut up. Can’t you hear me?”
This time, Arcane’s face had no choice but to harden.
“I’m desperately holding back. So shut up. One more word and I’ll crush you.”
Shirone’s body glowed with a faint red light. laser. The power had already been confirmed. If Harvest, who specializes in energy absorption, exploded with excessive energy, even a great wizard would have a chance to defeat him.
However, the friends who were watching had no choice but to dry their blood. The opponent, Shirone, the great magician who commanded the world, was just a student. A provocation of this kind was tantamount to suicide.
“What are you doing that for? Do you really know what’s going on?”
“no. It will be fine.”
Nade and Eruki looked back at Ethella at the same time.
“teacher. What does that mean? Shouldn’t it be dry now?”
“It’s a tricky situation for Arcane. I’m pushed out of the castle. If Shirone’s magic from earlier was the type that concentrated energy, the current Arcane cannot block Shirone’s magic. He’s not going to act out of emotion as long as there’s a chance he’ll be bitten. Shirone knows that.”
Nade looked back at Shirone. Even if that was the case, it was impossible for anyone other than Shirone to show courage to the archmage.
‘Anyway, it’s clever.’
Arcane readily acknowledged it.
“okay. If it were you now, you might be able to subdue me.”
For a moment, the surroundings became quiet. It was hard to believe that it came out of the mouth of an archmage. But it was not a thought born out of servitude. He had a rather relaxed smile.
“Red Wave. It seems to be the principle of vibrating particles, but it can truly be said to be the natural enemy of dark magic. Besides, I’m exhausted, so it’s going to be pretty hard to stop you.”
Arcane carefully observed Shirone’s reaction.
“How are you? After hearing this from the Archmage.”
“What do you mean? I wouldn’t have told you not to?”
“Magic, isn’t it fun?”
Shirone wrinkled his brow. She didn’t know what Arcane was talking about.
“That’s what magic is. It’s not fair, and there are no rules that say it has to be this way. It is unpredictable because there are no limits. In the world of magic, a meteorite wizard who can blow up a city can die at the hands of a mercenary wizard. Therefore, it wouldn’t be too strange if I got hurt by you.”
“So what do you want to talk about? Are you willing to pay for your sins?”
“I might take it that way, but… … .”
Dark smoke rose from Arcane’s body. There was white in her eyes, and her expression was ghostly. Sharp as a knife, life spread like an explosion in all directions.
“They say you have to fight to know.”
Shirone took a step backwards involuntarily. Pure fighting regardless of skill or level. He was the aura of death that only those who crossed countless lines of death could exude.
“No matter how good your match is, if you can’t win, it’s useless. How are you? Would you like to deal with me?”
Shirone’s lips, which had been confident until now, fell silent for the first time. To be honest, he didn’t feel like fighting. Arcane’s fighting spirit was overwhelming.
‘As expected, things are things.’
It persistently attacks its weak point, and immediately changes its stance as soon as it disappears. that there is no persistence. Thoughts are flexible like water, and vision is open to all directions. It was a little bit clear why Canis was defeated.

[93] Genius who lost his light (2)
“Good judgment. Ignoring 9 just because you got 1 out of 10 is stupid. Under no circumstances should you stop thinking. Everything in the world is determined by the amount of thoughts. The same goes for combat.”
“Don’t get me wrong. I will never forgive you.”
“Chuck! If you have the guts, there is nothing better. Shall I guess? You are the type to grow in practice. A school that only teaches stereotypes doesn’t suit you. How are you? won’t you come with me? Then I will make you the best wizard.”
“Don’t talk nonsense. I respect the teachers here much more than murderers like you.”
“Tell me, then. what have you learned here? Photon Cannon? red wave? If that’s not the case, did you give me advice on immortal functions?”
Shirone’s eyes widened slightly.
“How did you do that… … ?”
Arcane burst into laughter. It seems to be a teacher for this taste. Because I can round up kids who don’t know the world and talk nonsense to their heart’s content.
“It’s really rare. not to mention rare Is immortal function a normal state? But, child, there are many terrifying monsters living where you don’t know. If you hang out there with excitement… … .”
Arcane smiled, squinting one eye.
“Unlockers aren’t that rare either.”
Shirone swallowed dry saliva. How many slashes do you have to cross before you can say unlockers aren’t rare? Aside from skills, the accumulated experience itself was a different person.
“I met 7 people in 100 years. Four were quite good and three were killed. The Unlocker’s hallmark is its uniqueness. The possibilities for distortion are endless. But undisciplined uniqueness dies before a greater sense of security.”
It was an embarrassing but irrefutable statement. Personality can be a variable that ignores objective military power, but on the other hand, it was a double-edged sword that could lose power in front of the regular method.
“You learn nothing in a school that ignores individuality and teaches the same thing. You have to sharpen your own organs. If it were me, I could do that.”
“You don’t learn magic to defeat someone. Don’t treat me as a human being just like you.”
Arcane read the conflict in Shirone’s eyes. No wonder. If it weren’t for his obsession with magic and his desire for achievement, he wouldn’t have reached the position he is now.
“You think everyone likes you now. However, humans are naturally friendly to great people. It’s not because he likes you. How long do you think you can interact with such pretentious people?”
Everyone included in Arcane’s words frowned.
But Shirone just listened in silence.
“Be strong. So that they can’t ignore you forever. Otherwise they will crush you. Even in such a situation, can you avoid a fight with a nice excuse?”
Arcane spread three fingers.
“3 years. Within that, I will develop you into a skill that no one on the continent can ignore. Do you think 3 years is short? Not in my opinion. If you maximize your individuality, nothing is impossible.”
At least to Shirone, it wasn’t bullshit. As an Unlocker, there was little benefit for him to give up the guidance of the Archmage and remain at school. At best, he’s easy enough to get a job in the magical society?
“You are right.”
Eruki and Nade’s faces darkened.
“Shirone… … .”
If it is true, there is no need to deny it. The Unlocker was a unique position in the wizarding society, and there was a limit to developing skills with the leveling education of the magic school.
“Maybe you are right. But still I won’t follow. School is not a place where I have to fight, but a place where my life is contained. Teachers, friends, a sense of belonging. I don’t think you can give me anything like this.”
Arcane made an impression. I don’t know what Alfeas did, but I couldn’t help but admire his ability to brainwash his students.
“You are being deceived. When it comes to life, it doesn’t matter. If you weren’t strong, you would have been just a mediocre kid in school. Proving your strength is everything in life.”
“If that’s really all, why are you doing this?”
“what?”
“What’s left of you, who fought like that and became an archmage? everyone hates you Actually, aren’t you lonely too? No one is interested, so you can only prove it this way.”
Arcane gritted his teeth with a reddened face.
“You are talking nonsense. The strong are lonely. They are weak, so they try to unite. Look at the situation now. Everyone is kneeling at my feet. I am in control of them. That is loneliness.”
“no. You are just a murderer with no one looking after you.”
The word murderer sparked madness in Arcane’s eyes.
“ha ha ha! It could be. But do you know? That I also once had a colleague. But he ruined everyone around him. That is the Alfeas you admire.”
Shirone didn’t believe it. He had heard from Ethella that the two had a grudge. The Alpheas he knew was never the one to lead others to ruin.
“I don’t know what happened in the past, but I won’t listen to you. because he’s a murderer And he’s still committing murder.”
“You are a murderer. That Alpheas… … Even if you’re a murderer just like me?”
Shirone opened her eyes. He couldn’t help but be shocked this time.
“It is a lie. What do you know about the principal?”
“Chuck! Of course you know. Because that kid was my disciple.”
“what… … Called?”
Shirone was at a loss for words. Since childhood, Alpheas has been a pioneer of light magic. But how can a master of dark magic be a teacher?
Perhaps feeling the irony himself, Arcane looked up at the sky with vague eyes. The events of that day were still as vivid as yesterday. He stopped thinking and looked back at Ethella.
“Is Alpheas married?”
“no. He has been living alone for the rest of his life and is working hard on his education.”
“is it.”
A moment of sadness passed in Arcane’s eyes. Alfeas hated 40 years, but if there was anything left to sympathize with, it was Erina.
“I don’t know if you know, but Alfeas was married.”
Ethella tilted her head. As far as she knew, Alfeas was unmarried. Even if she got married and separated, it was normal that it should remain on record as it was the union of her family.
“But the headmaster is single on paper.”
“Looks like you haven’t been recognized after all. Still, Alpheas is married. Because she lived together for three years. She was a woman named Erina. she was a great woman She shone more than anyone else and was beautiful.”
“What happened between the two of you? Is it something that still deserves resentment after 50 years?”
“At the time, Alpheas was recognized as one of the newcomers whose photon theory was recognized. He was awarded the Gold Circle by the Emperor, so you guessed the stature, right? Her job at the dragon’s magic department was confirmed, and she was living with a woman from the Bastard family, so there was nothing to envy in the world. But she also had concerns for him.”
Arcane tapped her head and said.
“My wife Erina’s intelligence has declined a little. She was at the level of a ten-year-old.”
“I see.”
“But Alpheas didn’t care. He truly loved his wife. His love was never pity or pretense.”
Arcane’s memories went back in time. The time was 40 years ago. It was a time when Arcane ruled the world and Alpheas, who entered the world of magic, was called a supernova.
“Gold Circle Award of the Year! Mirhi Alpheas!”
Fanfare rang in the Grand Hall. Alpheas shed tears of emotion as he was hit by colored paper falling from the ceiling. The Gold Circle Award given to the wizard with the best achievement in a year. Once he won the prize, he could not only enter the Yongle, but also receive support from numerous aristocratic families.
“Congratulations, Alfeas. Of course I knew you would ride.”
“I wish you well in the future. Surely you won’t forget your alumni just because you’ve succeeded?”
Numerous mages gathered around Alpheas. Since his stock price would rise endlessly in the future, he was trying to take a look at it in advance.
However, there were certainly undesirable views. In particular, the face of Sarov, who had been fighting for the prize until the end, was crumpled as if he had chewed shit.
“joy. I caught a nerd and got out. Since it’s a combination of Mirhi and Bastard, how can I overcome that?”
“Say that. Truly, medicine is your friend. But what can I do, the result came out like this. From now on, we also have to cover up what we say to Alpheas.”
Sarov knew. In any case, since he couldn’t leave the wizarding society, it was best to get close to Alpheas.
“What are you going to do, Sarov? It gets weirder when we meet separately. Are you secretly burying me and asking for reconciliation?”
“No, I don’t feel like that. I’m fine, so why don’t you come too?”
“It’s the same feeling. just do it later Because two are better than one. Would you like to go out for a drink?”
“I will. I don’t want to stay here any longer.”
Sarov took his friends and left the castle. Sarov was also a finalist who narrowly missed out on the Gold Circle award, but no one cared about the losers.
Klump burst into a big laugh and dragged Alpheas out of the crowd. Alfeas wanted to take a breather, but his face was caught in Klump’s forearm and he shook violently.
“Hahahaha! this bastard! You did it! My friend received the Gold Circle! I can’t believe it!”
“it hurts! It hurts!”
Alpheas screamed, but Klump’s celebration didn’t stop.
“When I pretended to be unluckily smart, I really wanted to beat it up, but now I see that I was a genius, right? You did it, man!”
Alpheas felt dizzy and was about to die, but he didn’t think about getting out. It’s a gold circle. When, if not today, will you experience this exhilarating pain?
“now! It’s a good day, so let’s drink until our noses are crooked. The bar is reserved, so you can leave your brain and go with your stomach.”
Alfeas finally got out of the head lock and said with an apologetic smile.
“Oh, I don’t think it will work right away? I’ll go somewhere for a while.”
“what? If the main character is missing, why are we toasting for fun?”
“To go home. I want to hang a medal on her wife.”
Even Klump couldn’t stop it. Although she married Erina a year ago, she was not even supported by the opposition of her parents’ families, and she was living in a small house for newlyweds in a common district.
It started with the Mirhi family. His son, who had sent him to study abroad, said he would marry an idiot woman, so there was no way he would agree.
Then the Bastard family responded without losing. Even in the same first-class aristocrat, there was a clear difference between the province and the capital, so he was in the position that he would not be inferior even if his daughter was a little short.
In the end, Alpheas and Erina had no choice but to hold an informal wedding ceremony at a gathering of only their friends.
“Right. There was Mr. Jesu. Why don’t you bring it?”
“it’s okay. What wife would love to see her husband play with a drunkard? She’ll just be back for a while.”
“Damn it, you’re noticing it. Then go quickly.”
“I’ll be back soon. Go to the bar first!”
Alpheas came out of the castle as if he were running away. He worked hard day and night to study, and his stamina was exhausted, but he was not out of breath today.
‘done! I did it!’
Won the most prestigious award in the kingdom. With this achievement, the Mirhi family would have no choice but to accept themselves again, so having a spiritual wedding with Erina was not a dream either.
“Honey, I’m here.”
Erina knew that it was the day the winners were decided. She came out of the kitchen just like yesterday, although in a different house she would have prepared a surprise party.
“came? Did you eat?”
—————————————

[94] Genius who lost his light (3)
Alpheas liked her like that. The intelligence of a ten-year-old does not necessarily mean that the mind itself is a ten-year-old. Tears welled up in her eyes as she thought about her husband’s heartache because of his failure to win the award.
“Honey, I… … .”
Alpheas took out the golden medallion with trembling hands.
“I did it! I rode it! It’s a Gold Circle Award!”
Erina is always calm and composed, but this time, her bright eyes that seemed to contain the world couldn’t help but waver. The day that Alpheas had been talking about had really come.
“congratulation. I knew you would ride.”
“Erina, thanks to you. that you did everything Come and see. I will walk you.”
Alpheas thought that the true owner of the Gold Circle was Erina. Of course, the honest Klump didn’t understand. He thought that Alpheas, who deciphered the true intentions of Erina, was more important than Erina’s innocence. But Alpheas knew. That the small idea that came from Erina’s head would become the core code responsible for the future of mankind.
“This is your award. Your thoughts shocked the world.”
As Alpheas approached with his lips sticking out, Erina pulled herself out like a bridesmaid and said.
“I need to eat. Come quickly.”
“Oh sorry. Klump is throwing a party so I think we should go. I will eat rice later.”
“Oh yeah.”
Erina couldn’t hide her sadness this time either. Then her alpheas laughed at her mischievously and lifted her up.
“That’s why you say you have to save time to eat.”
“Kyaaak!”
Alpheas strode up the stairs to the second floor while holding Erina in his arms.
“Wait! I’m going to burn the bread with this.”
“Tell me to ride! Otherwise I will burn!”
After Alpheas won the award, dozens of invitations flew in every single day. All of them were sent by nobles or organizations that were said to be the best. To get along with everyone is to get along with nobody. His reputation quickly spread thanks to his ransom while refusing any connections other than necessary. As part of that strategy, Alpheas left home today to attend a dinner invited by the Alchemy Foundation. It was an institution responsible for 40 percent of the volume of magic materials transported, so it was a position that could not be left out.
But Sarov and his friends, unaware of this fact, were camped out in front of Alfeas’ house before the sun went down. Their mood as they waited for the evening to come was impatient.
Sarov sighed.
“Haa, that hurts your pride.”
“Do you have a problem with your ego? Even if the value went up, it went up too much. Speaking of Alpheas. He wasn’t just a man who was good at magic. He should have predicted it in advance.”
Sarov was also full of regret. When he won the Gold Circle award, he had to somehow blend in with the crowd and clear up the sediment. It had only been a month since he received the award, but Alfeas’ reputation had risen to the point of being terrified. All of this was due to his outstanding political skills. Now, as Alpheas also covers people, the gap that Sarov could squeeze into had to become even narrower.
‘Oh shit. I didn’t want to lower my head, but it made me kneel down. Why doesn’t this happen?’
It was a question that could not be answered no matter how much I thought about it. It was comforting that there were friends who were with me, so the embarrassment would be a little less.
“Go in slowly. I will speak.”
Sarov took the lead and knocked on the door of Alpheas’ house.
“Is there Alpheas? I am Sarov.”
The person who opened the door was unexpectedly Erina.
“who are you?”
“Oh, your wife is there. I don’t know if you remember, but I’m Sarov, a classmate of Alfeas. Are you at Alfeas’ house?”
“no. Her husband is out. It’s the Alchemy Foundation.”
I knew that there was a dinner party at the Alchemy Foundation. But since it’s not a drinking party, it won’t take long. Sarov said politely, thinking that it was better.
“okay. If you don’t mind, may I go in and wait? Because people are paying attention… … .”
It was embarrassing to have come all the way to the house, but it was clear that I would get caught up in gossip if I snooped in front of the door.
“Yes, come in.”
Sarov sat in the living room with his friends and rubbed his hands nervously. It seemed pitiful to see them, but Erina invited them to the table and served them snacks and drinks.
“You are eating something. Her husband will eat there.”
“thank you. You are very kind.”
Sarov, quite embarrassed, regretted not bringing a present. He bought it just in case, but when he tried to carry it, he couldn’t stand it because he was upset.
It’s not about skill. No matter how much he cut ties with Alpheas and Erina’s both families, he had a first-class name value, and he thought that it would have had some influence on the evaluation.
As I passed the drink with such thoughts, I quickly became drunk. At first, she endured with her nervousness, but from the moment she felt Erina’s level of intelligence, her mind was relaxed without realizing it.
“I mean! Even so, he was once called a genius. I, it is me!”
“Who is not? The world is so unfair! People who have worked hard write porridge, and anyone can get ahead with connections! Magic is already dead!”
One of Sarov’s eyebrows went up at his friend’s words. The person his friend was shooting was none other than Alfeas. But he let it go. Anyway, Erina wouldn’t even know what she was talking about. She was suddenly drunk. Maybe she won Alfeas for the first time? How could she criticize so loudly in front of her wife?
‘Hmph, what an insult that bastard gave me. This is about medicine, medicine and medicine.’
Sarov went one step further and spoke to Erina.
“Isn’t that so, Mr. Jesu? It’s magic, because it’s not something that can be done only with skill. Do you agree with Jesu?”
“Yes, I don’t know.”
“ha ha ha! sure. You wouldn’t know. But it’s true. Everything I say is true.”
Sarov tasted the thrill of victory. In addition to criticizing Alpheas, he was sarcastic towards his wife. The friends who caught Sarov’s intention joined by knocking on the table.
“Jesu-ssi, the atmosphere is great, but why don’t you try singing a song?”
“is it so! Pick a song to celebrate the success of Alfeas.”
Erina’s smile hardened. People think that if they are less intelligent, they will not know anything. However, reading the emotions of others has always been the responsibility of the weak. She also knew that Sarov’s party was not friendly. Even so, she was just trying to accept her husband’s friends.
“When the wheat in my hometown is ripe… … .”
When Erina started singing, Sarov and the others clapped and blew whistles. Even in the midst of that, she continued to sing with a trembling tone.
But before I could sing three bars, I heard a cold voice from the living room.
“What are you doing?”
I turned my head without saying who it was. Alpheas stood with her fists clenched with a red face. Sarov sobered up. When his sanity returned, he finally realized what he was doing.
“Mi, I’m sorry. It looks like we had too much to drink.”
“You son of a bitch!”
Alfeas, who had strode forward, swung his fist. Sarov, who had been hit in the face with a straight blow, fell to the floor. Then the friends jumped up and shouted.
“Alfeas! What a nasty thing! No matter how angry you are… … !”
“No, that’s okay. quit.”
Sarov raised his hand to stop his friends. he was ashamed of himself Was I just like this? Was it just a loser taking comfort in flirting with a competitor’s wife?
“Get out, before I kill you. Get out of this house right now!”
“I’m sorry about what happened today. I won’t come back in the future.”
Sarov and his friends are kicked out of Alfeas’ house. There was silence in the living room where the uninvited guest had left. Alpheas had no way to stop his rising anger. I knew why they had her Erina sing her songs.
“What happened? Why are those children here?”
Erina was terrified and said nothing. It was the first time her husband had ever been so angry.
“say! Why did you bring those children in!”
“sorry. Because I’m your friend, I know you’ll like it… … .”
“What are you talking about? Why is that kid my friend? Can’t tell the difference between a real friend and a friend? Are you still singing? What a fool you are!”
Alpheas turned wildly. His face contorted with regret as he lowered his head. Words that he should never have used, and that he had sworn he would never use, slipped out of his mouth.
‘You trash child. I’m not even a person.’
I wanted to turn back time, but it was already too late. No, even if he returned it, he might have said the same thing. I couldn’t contain my anger and it was driving me crazy.
“Forget what you just said. I made a mistake.”
“Honey, I was wrong. I won’t do that anymore.”
Erina’s words made her heart ache even more. It’s not her job to apologize. But then, where the hell am I supposed to throw this resentment?
“I’ll go get some fresh air. You’ll be fine with time. Sorry. Sleep first today.”
Alpheas left the house. That was the only way to rationally resolve the current situation.
He went to the inn where Klump was staying and drank all night. he didn’t get drunk As he grew drunker, Sarov was erased from his memory, and only the scars Erina must have received came to mind.
“Damn it. i’m trash I don’t deserve a husband. I’m the only one who trusted and followed her. For me to talk to her like that.”
Klump made a pitiful expression. Because he was a man himself, he could understand Alfeas’ anger. But he didn’t change the idea that he made a mistake.
“They say that a husband and wife fight is like cutting water with a knife. The future is bright now, and the bad times have passed. Wouldn’t it be possible to get closer with today?”
As Alpheas remained silent, Klump brought up what he had been thinking about before.
“Why don’t you have a baby now?”
Alpheas’ eyes twinkled for a moment. But she shook her head with a grim expression.
Guessing something, Klump raised his eyes in surprise.
“What, you, can’t you? Not even once… … .”
“What nonsense are you talking about? we are a couple No matter how young Erina is, she knows everything.”
“Sheesh, who said what? It means that you might be a eunuch, not Jesu. I’m talking about being dishonest. Kuck.”
Alpheas, not in the mood to laugh, stared at the glass and poured it bitterly.
Klump sighed and said.
“I am So what the hell is wrong? It’s enough to give birth to a child and live happily ever after.”
“Erina is… … I don’t know if she will be able to bear children.”
“why? Are you not feeling well anywhere?”
“no. Actually it is. Childbirth is a terrible pain, but will Erina be able to endure it? There are also parenting issues.”
Klump, who pondered over Alpheas’ words, sighed. In the end, it was a question of whether a ten-year-old intelligent woman would be able to endure her labor pains. Intelligence is a great power that controls humans. There was a world of difference between suffering knowingly and suffering without knowing.
“Alpheas, it’s a little hard to say this, but you knew it too. Ever since I thought about marriage… … .”
“Yeah, I know. no regrets No, I don’t really regret it. I can’t live without Erina. If she is not her, she means no glory.”
Klump poured two glasses down his throat in quick succession. He himself is frustrated, but what can the person concerned do?
“So what are you thinking? It’s not like you to complain like this. What’s wrong with a smart guy?”
Alpheas turned his glass round and round, deep in thought. Then, at some point, his eyes, which resisted drunkenness, shone intelligently.

[95] Genius who lost his light (4)
Arcane knew that someone broke into his dungeon last night. But he didn’t care. It was because there were many people who entered the Archmage’s dungeon aiming for riches. By now, he would have been turned into a corpse from a monster or trap.
Arcane erased his thoughts for a while and focused on his research again. Recently, he has been digging into the effect of dark magic on memory. His hands, which were frantically writing down the thesis, suddenly stopped. Then he took off his glasses and looked towards the door. Engine devices were disengaging at high speed. He wasn’t an ordinary guy.
“Did you catch a fish after a long time?”
Dungeon raiders were a good pastime for Arcanes, who would not go out of their way for years once locked away. Besides, it seemed that a decent human being had bitten the bait today.
When the iron door opened with a thud, Arcane looked at his watch. Exactly 32 hours 28 minutes 5 seconds. It was the time to dismantle the engine unit from the entrance to this place and reach it.
“The Archmage… … Are you Viltor Arcane?”
He was a bloody man. He was handsome and his eyes were shining with firearms.
“You don’t look like someone who is greedy for money. Who are you?”
“My name is Mirhi Alfeas. There was no way to meet him, so I came to see him in person.”
“Hoo?”
Arcane’s eyebrows went up. It doesn’t make sense to turn a blind eye to the outside situation just because you’re stuck in a dungeon. He had already come across Alpheas’ photon theory through a secret route.
“For a light wizard to visit a dark wizard. What a peculiar thing. sit down at once I will cure you.”
Arcane activated the life support system. As soon as Alpheas entered the hemispherical device filled with green liquid, he fell into a deep sleep.
3 hours after that.
“Puha! Haha!”
Alpheas raised his upper body above the water. He would almost suffocate if he tried. But how could I fall asleep? As he turned his head with his doubts, Arcane was sitting at his desk writing his thesis. It was an academic appearance that could not be seen as a great wizard who disturbed the continent.
“Thank you for the treatment. That’s a nice device. I’m curious about the principle.”
“There is nothing to talk about. That doesn’t change the fact that you’re an uninvited guest. Tell me why you came to me.”
A person driven by curiosity and interest would not need to waste time.
Alpheas went straight to the point.
“I want to learn dark magic. Please accept me as your disciple.”
“Hoo?”
The hottest issue right now is that Alpheas begs his pupil. Even the Arcanes of the world could not help but be interested in it.
“Is there any particular reason?”
“I have a wife. However, intellectual abilities decline. Rumor has it that you are doing research on storing memories in dark magic, and I want to give my memories to her wife.”
Arcane’s eyes flashed. We knew each other’s majors anyway, so there was no need for long words.
“I did quite a bit of research on memory manipulation. But what you’re asking for is on a different level. There is also a personality problem, and above all, it is a work that requires the entire life of one person to be moved.”
“I think it is possible. If we combine the absorption of dark magic and the information transfer ability of photons, wouldn’t it be possible to implement virtual intelligence?”
“Hmm, build a nervous system with photon magic and endow it with memories?”
It was definitely a novel idea. Until now, photon magic had limited effectiveness enough to be called time magic, but Arcane expected that it would stand out in the information field in the future as long as the photon theory was revealed.
“Before examining the theory, I have one question. Did your wife approve of the experiment?”
“I don’t know yet. But I will definitely respond.”
“I wonder if there is a story.”
Alpheas confessed how he came to this place. Upon hearing the story, Arcane understood his feelings. Besides, the suggestion was certainly genius. Over the course of a day, the two reviewed the possibilities. When they came to an agreement on the theoretical basis, they agreed that the arcanes were not vain delusions.
“Good. If you are really prepared to risk your life, I will accept you as a disciple. But it won’t be easy to convince the family.”
Although he would become a disciple of the Archmage, Alpheas was also a son of a prestigious family. He thought that the possibility of leaving the future of a job in the dragon’s magic department and entering the gloomy laboratory was slim.
However, Alpheas did not have other routes in mind. If Erina is unhappy, she is also unhappy. He only wanted Erina to be happy.
“thank you. I will bring my family back soon.”
After returning home, Alfeas consulted with Erina. Since it was a matter of life, Klumph was also seated. The part Alpheas emphasized was that Erina’s intellectual future could be cured. And Klump objected as soon as his words were finished.
“Alpheas, what are you talking about? Why would you go find someone like that? Is he a criminal?”
“It doesn’t matter to a wizard. What really matters is that he has the best understanding of dark magic on the continent. He also knows a lot about human memory and brain structure. He won’t be at a loss.”
“No, I have to lose. you’re obsessed with something Planting memories in the human brain? There’s no way that’s possible!”
“Klump, why do you think so… … .”
“okay! I’m stupid! I’m not as smart as you, I’m not even a genius! But even this country knows one thing. You are kicking away the fortune that has rolled in now. If you hang out with someone like that, your entry into the dragon mine will be cancelled. What about the family name? Your family will really abandon you!”
There was no way Alpheas was unaware of that fact. But it was a decision he had made after much thought.
“doesn’t care. Because those things can’t decide my life. It’s the Yongroego family, and I don’t need all of them. If only Erina can be happy, I can be much happier than now.”
Erina was troubled. However, with Alpheas’ last words, the decision had already been made. If her husband was happy, she could be happy with Erina as well.
“Honey, I will.”
“Jesu! This is something to think about.”
“I will. Because she trusts her husband. Alpheas will make me happy.”
“Then, of course! Who am I? He’s a wizard who received the Gold Circle. And my master is the Archmage. If we join hands, we can easily fix your weaknesses.”
Klump came every day to persuade Alpheas, but he couldn’t break the couple’s stubbornness. In the end, Alfeas arranged all his assets and entered Arcane’s dungeon with Erina.
“Nice to meet you. It is called Viltor Arcane.”
“hello. Her husband owes it.”
Erina greeted politely. She was henceforth her husband’s teacher, so her actions could not be taken lightly.
But Arcane comforted her as if she didn’t care.
“Don’t worry too much. Even so, I have been immersed in this field for decades. It’s a big decision. Success can cure many mentally ill people. Your husband will also gain a reputation that is incomparable to that of Yongleo.”
To become a disciple of the Archmage. Besides, if the reward for her success was to get back everything her husband had given up, she thought Erina might as well.
For the next two years, Alfeas resided in the dungeon and conducted research on transferring memories to his wife. Arcane was an expert in experimentation enough to run a personal dungeon. Under his reasonable care, Erina was able to spend her time in the dungeon without any inconvenience.
“Hey, Mr. Jesu. How are you?”
Once a week, Klump came to bring food. Even if the two of them were busy experimenting, wouldn’t it be possible to make Erina eat the bitter food?
“are you okay. The experiment will be over soon. Then her husband will be able to go out into the world again.”
Klump let out a hearty laugh. It must have been difficult for him to do this and that for two years, but he endured it very well. So he was also bitter at the same time. What if you lose some intelligence? Her heart of sacrificing for her husband was never vulgar.
Upon hearing that Klump had arrived, Alfeas went to the room. As Erina said, he seems to be pushing spur after spur, but his face was emaciated every time he came.
“I’m here? Thank you every time.”
“How about an experiment? Any progress?”
“Almost done. Clinical trials have been successful. Next month, Erina will also be free from the disgusting gaze.”
“next month? Is it that fast?”
“What are you talking about? It’s almost two years. He said he stayed up all night studying with Master. Anyway, you should come that day too. At that time, bring a lot of alcohol, not food.”
A month was a long time for everyone.
Eventually, however, time passed and the long-awaited moment of execution arrived.
Erina lay down on the bed and waited. Since Arcane and Alfeas were busy checking the machinery, Klump talked to her so she wouldn’t be nervous.
“Jesu, how are you feeling? After today, Jesu-san will have the memories of Alfeas. He even remembers peeing on the duvet when he was little. Think carefully about whether or not you have flirted with other women. ha ha ha!”
Erina burst into laughter at Klump’s joke. You can’t be nervous, but the atmosphere was good. It was the kind of day when everything seemed to be going well, and the test equipment was judged to be fine.
“Then let’s begin, Erina.”
Alpheas lay down next to Erina and stroked her hair. Because you are the person you love the most in the world, you can give them memories. Neither her shameful memories nor her shameful memories mattered to her if it was her.
“Honey, thank you.”
“What are you talking about. I’m grateful. It has held up really well. let’s live happily and have children.”
Alpheas was worried that his smile was awkward. To be honest, he was on the verge of losing his mind with the tension. Arcane came over and attached a mechanical device to both of their heads. It was an experiment in which reports from all fields such as magic engineering, magic biology, alchemy, photon mechanics, and human biology were gathered.
“I will begin. Relax. It will be over soon.”
As Arcane prepared to activate the device, Klump walked to the corner and rubbed his hands nervously. The engine unit lowered with a clank. Dozens of detailed organs turned with mechanical sounds, and crystals shone and disturbed the scenery.
Alpheas accepted the dark magic penetrating into his head without resistance.
The key principle was simple. Absorb Alpheas’ memories through dark magic. Then, transmit it through the photon output and overwrite Erina’s memory.
“Huh!”
Erina’s eyes widened. Sparks flew in her eyes as the massive amount of information came in. From the first memory of Alpheas’ life to the memory of the conversation a while ago, all the times that formed him were being transmitted at the speed of light.
Erina smiled faintly. She felt truly united with Alfeas.
The excitement and worries of meeting for the first time, the anticipation of marriage, and the happiness of newlyweds. The heart that loved him without any prejudice has been passed down in its entirety.
‘Honey, thank you. And I love you.’
Erina closed her eyes. No regrets. Since she was born into the world, she has been loved beyond measure.
Meeting Alpheas… … It was fortunate.
The experiment ended when the light faded. Arcane checked the instrument panel. 100 percent information transfer rate. All memories were transferred perfectly.
“honey! honey!”
Alpheas turned to Erina. He had a pale complexion and was breaking out in a cold sweat.

[96] Genius who lost his light (5)
“Master! How did it go? Was the experiment successful?”
“Yes, it worked! Our magic worked!”
But Alpheas couldn’t be happier. No matter how you look at it, Erina’s condition was strange.
“But why is my wife like this? honey! Come to your senses!”
Arcane looked at the instrument panel once again and was shocked. The balance of each item was normal, but the overall body rhythm was falling at the same time. It was as if life itself was dying out.
“Hey, why is this? Obviously, this was not the case in clinical trials.”
“honey! Erina! Open your eyes!”
Erina half-opened her eyes and smiled faintly.
“honey… … I’m OK.”
“Erina! What happened? what’s the matter? What’s not good?”
“A rejection reaction occurred from the terminal nerve. There must be something different about the human brain. But you did a really great job. A little more research… … Huh!”
Erina took a deep breath and convulsed.
“honey! Do not say! I’ll try my best! I’ll save you no matter what… … !”
Alpheas was already cursed with his own intellect, which he realized was irreversible. But he couldn’t help but say it.
Erina shook her head slowly. What her husband knew, she knew herself.
“honey… … Please hold my hand.”
Alpheas gripped his wife’s hand tightly. He would have tried if there was even a 1 percent chance. But for now, it was all about keeping her side.
“Erina, it can’t be like this. How could this… … .”
Erina smiled sadly.
“Honey, I’m sorry.”
“What are you sorry about? what are you… … .”
“Because I am stupid.”
Alpheas’ heart was torn to pieces. Trying to change his wife. Why did I forget her words that she is beautiful just by existing?
“no… … why are you sorry What are you sorry about! it’s me! I was stupid! The fool was me!”
“I’m glad I met you.”
Erina was finally able to understand her husband. A wonderful world where rationality reigns. he was living here. I was happy to be able to be with him even for a short moment, to be able to leave with his memories.
“honey! Open your eyes! please… … I was wrong, honey!”
As Erina’s eyes closed, Alfeas hugged her face and sobbed.
“Aaaaaaa! honey! honey!”
Arcane lowered her head with a sad expression. How is the human brain different from that of animals? Had human experiments been conducted from the start, there would have been no tragedy.
But it was a meaningless assumption. There is only one condition that Erina put forward to experimenting on herself. She never said that she should never experiment on others.
That’s why I paid more attention. The data obtained so far would be valuable for mankind.
‘I’m sorry. I won’t let your sacrifice be in vain.’
A pop and dull sound rang out. When he turned his head, Alfeas was banging his head against the wall.
“Aaaaaaa!”
Every time their foreheads collided, there was a cracking sound. It was to the point where I didn’t know if the walls were breaking or if my head was breaking.
“what? The light of the Mirhi family? light? light!”
thud! thud! thud!
Alpheas’ body bounced off like a rubber ball. But he didn’t stop. The horror of being left alone with his wife turned his stomach.
“Arrogant Alfeas!”
Alpheas rushed into the wall again.
thud!
Klump grabbed Alfeas. If I left it like this, I would die without moving.
“Alfeas! Wake! What are you doing!”
“Let go! damn it! Aaaaaaa!”
It was difficult to stop Alpheas even with Klumph’s physical strength. It was as if he was burning his soul and rushing towards his death. But in the end, his pupils dried up as if the shock was intense, and his consciousness went away.
“Erina… … . Erina… … .”
Klump also shed tears when he called his wife’s name even in a faint state.
* * *
Erina’s funeral was held. It was a gathering of only members of the family, and Alfeas was prevented from attending by his relatives. He never married and has no heirs. In the end, the two of them had to say goodbye while they were dating.
Alpheas was sitting in front of the funeral parlor. Then, as the sun went down, he got up from his seat and walked away like a man out of his mind.
The place they arrived at was Arcane’s dungeon. Many of the equipment that had been experimented on for two years remained intact.
“Erina… … .”
Alpheas took an oil canister and scattered it all over the laboratory. Every time the oil splashed, tears flowed from his eyes. The moment of her laughing and talking with her was as vivid as if it had happened yesterday.
When the oil drum exposed the floor, Alpheas sat down with his back against the wall. It is knowledge that should not exist in the world. How could a human being do such a cruel experiment?
“Are you here, Alfeas?”
Arcane entered the laboratory. He knew that Alfeas wasn’t even invited to his funeral. After all, for him, this was the grave of his wife.
“I’m sorry about Erina’s work. Take care of your mind and body for the time being. Then come back… … .”
Arcane realized something and turned his head. She smelled too much oil to believe it was leaking from the mechanism.
“Alpheas… … can you?”
Alpheas stood up with dark eyes. One shot of fire magic would blow up the entire laboratory.
“no! What are you doing!”
“Master, it was something I shouldn’t have done from the beginning.”
“I understand that your wife’s death has weakened you! But no! The experiment almost succeeded! Did you forget Erina’s will? Erasing this place is disregarding even Erina’s sacrifice!”
“You don’t need anything. Now without a wife… … I have nothing left.”
“Even so, no! This isn’t just you and Erina. My lifelong knowledge is also accumulated! These are documents that cannot be destroyed without my permission.”
Alpheas cast fire magic. Arcane absorbed it with dark magic, but it couldn’t be helped as the temperature rose above the ignition point.
Flames covered the room.
Thousands of papers, precise magical devices, and difficult-to-handle alchemy substances were also denatured.
Alfeas, who had been looking at the flames indifferently, left the dungeon.
But Arcane couldn’t leave. he has to turn off the lights No, even if you lose everything, you must protect the experimental data.
“No no!”
Going back and forth through the fire, Arcane was preoccupied with collecting documents. Eventually, the box containing the vaporized material caught fire and exploded.
The whole laboratory was blown away, and the shock was transmitted to the extent that the entire underground dungeon was shaken.
A terrifyingly air-sucking fire galloped through the tunnel.
“Aaaaaa! Alpheas! I will not forgive you, Alfeas!”
Arcane gritted his teeth. Right before he completed the masterpiece of his life, he felt more injustice and resentment than dying that the data had been lost.
“certainly… … make sure you survive and will take revenge Wait, Alfeas!”
Arcane hated Alpheas even as he burned. The arrogant Alpheas was arrogant to the end.
Having survived with a single spirit of revenge, he conserved his strength and mobilized all his personal connections to search the continent. However, no one knew about Alpheas’s whereabouts.
Seven years later, Alpheas reappeared in the world.
It was the main house of the Ogent family in the city of Creas.
“Alfeas! Hey man! What have you been up to?”
Klump stared blankly at Alfeas, who had become a completely different person. Her neat face was gone and she was growing a beard like a madman. Dressed in rags, her skin was charred.
Klump took Alfeas to the bathroom and washed him himself. Numerous wounds were carved on her body. Because it was a test, it was possible to distinguish. Wounds from wild beasts, wounds from torture, and obvious self-inflicted wounds.
“Did you go around looking for a place to die?”
Alpheas did not answer as he covered his face with his wet hair. Then, after a while, he opened his mouth.
“I had no intention of dying. I didn’t even want to live there. I just wandered around.”
“okay… … .”
“I heard you. He said he was an accredited prosecutor. Congratulations.”
“What is the celebration between us. Among my peers, I’m the latest, man.”
Klump accepted it shyly. He wasn’t particularly proud of the achievements his friend had made while experiencing hell in the backcountry.
“sorry. I have nowhere else to go but here. Let’s take care of ourselves.”
Klump stared at Alpheas’ withered back sadly.
How did it get to this point?
He, who was called the supernova of the wizarding society, has now been kicked out of his family and has fallen into a vagabond without any nobles he knows.
After taking a bath, Klump prepared a meal for the ladies-in-waiting. However, even her stomach shrank, so Alfeas couldn’t pass much of her food.
Klump knew. Just because I have nowhere to go, I’m not the type to come to you.
After taking Alpheas into the study, he offered a drink. Alpheas didn’t even look at the drink. Just like the look he had seven years ago, his intelligent eyes flashed past him.
“say it. It must have appeared in the world because the wandering was over. You won’t have to recover either. If I can help, I will help.”
Alpheas spoke straight.
“Lend me 100 million gold.”
“1 million… … gold?”
It was a huge sum of money.
Of course, Klump obtained the right to succeed the governor by passing the official exam. However, even if he became the head of household, there was a limit to the amount he could contribute.
“I’m not asking you to borrow it all at once. I’ll withdraw over 4 years. Hire a treasurer. If you set the monthly limit to 7 million, you will be able to operate without any damage. I will also pay interest. However, compounding is not possible. Instead, I’ll set it at an annual rate of 20 percent. The principal repayment will be possible after one year.”
The method of repayment was decided by the lender, but Klump didn’t care. If it was the Alfeas he knew, he would have thought of the optimal trading conditions even before he came here.
In the end, he was talking about earning 80 million gold excluding the principal after 4 years, but I was more curious about how he would do that.
“What are you thinking? Have you developed any new magic?”
Alpheas shook his head.
“I have no passion anymore.”
“Then what are you going to do with the 100 million gold?”
“I will build a school.”
“what? school?”
Klump opened his eyes wide. Alpheas, who thought he was the best between heaven and earth, would teach others.
“What are you thinking… … .”
Seeing the tears flowing down Alpheas’ cheeks, Klump was speechless.
“never… … People like me shouldn’t come out. I will teach students while atonement until the moment I die. I will live by gnawing away at my pain so that my talent will not be trampled on by a momentary mistake.”
Alpheas covered his face with both hands and sobbed. Still, he couldn’t stop the tears from flowing.
Klump’s eyes also turned red.
Bastard Erina. Perhaps Alpheas will never forget her. She may have to live with suffering for the rest of her life.
But that’s why the decision was easy.
If the pain that Alpheas had to endure could be sublimated into someone else’s growth, if it really could happen, I wondered if this friend who dreamed of happiness rather than success would have a day to smile in the distant future.
“Don’t lend me. 100 million gold.”
Alpheas founded a school named after him in the city of Creas. During the construction period, he worked as a wizard to pay off the interest and studied at night to obtain a teacher’s license.
and 4 years later.
Mirhi Alfeas, principal of Alfeas Magic School, paid 180 million gold to the Ogent family.
* * *
When the effect of Abyss Nova completely disappeared, Alpheas slowly opened his eyes. All his memories returned, but he was speechless for a long time. His 40 years, reiterated back to back, were so long and heavy.

“Master… … .”
Thaad did not hesitate to speak. Is Alpheas really the old Alpheas? Humans have hope because they do not know the future. However, there was no hope in Alpheas’ memories. Any happy memories were buried in terrible pain.
Alpheas closed his eyes again. A drop of tear flowed down.
“Master, are you okay?”
“Thank you, Thaad.”
Thaad let out a sigh of relief at the benevolent tone.
“Are you really okay?”
“Nothing. I’m sorry I said harsh things to you. But that’s who I used to be.”
“no. I’m sorry. I thought Master would be wrong, so I’d rather stay the same… … .”
Alfeas patted Thaad’s shoulder.
“It was your decision. Maybe that was good.”
“Master, then… … .”
Thaad became anxious again. Maybe he should have pushed on as he initially thought. It must have been an opportunity for escape that would never come again for Alpheas.
“okay. It’s a memory I never want to recall. but… … .”
Alpheas looked at Erina’s portrait. When I remembered the moment we first met and confessed at the ballroom, a gentle smile came to my lips.
“No matter how painful life is, there are times when we live only to protect one moment.”
“okay.”
Thaad was finally relieved. Alpheas was Alpheas, no different from the old one.
A woman named Erina, who had shaken a person’s entire life, had settled in Alpheas’ heart as a painful but irresistible memory.
“Master, the one who committed this incident is Arcane. Currently, Mr. Ethella… … .”
“I had a hunch from the time I got hit. It’s not the time to listen to explanations. Let’s move.”
As Alpheas walked to the door, Thaad followed. The first hurdle was passed, but the problem started now. The entire school was under the spell of Arcane.
‘Please don’t be late.’
to infinity(1)
After learning about Alpheas’ past, Shirone and the others were silent for a while. It was such a shocking event and it was a heartbreakingly sad love story.
“That’s what happened to the principal… … .”
A certified 4th class wizard and the principal of a prestigious school. I thought it was a successful life no matter who saw it. However, if you listen to Arcane’s story, Alpheas in his youth was really great. Gold Circle winner who proved the photon theory at the age of ten. In particular, the memory transfer experiment was a progressive idea that the wizarding community had finally begun researching.
“Obviously, Alpheas was a genius. But I was weak. The world would have been different if I had only endured a little. But a little affection ruined everything. I can never forgive Alpheas like that.”
Shirone thought a lot. Arcane was a world-recognized villain, but he was also a wizard. At least in Erina’s experiment, he was just a great helper.
“okay. The principal may have been hypocritical in destroying your data.”
Because Arcane’s murderous spirit had softened, Shirone was able to get a little closer.
“But I would have made the same choice.”
“Does that sound come out even after seeing Alpheas? Well, in your eyes, an official 4th grade might look amazing. However, if you are swayed by your emotions, you cannot rise to the top. Erina’s death is unfortunate, but magic is magic. In that sense, Alpheas was unqualified.”
Shirone shook her head. History will tell you what was right, but Alpheas was not swayed by emotion. At least he thought so.
“If the experiment had been carried out further, there would have been numerous victims. You would have conducted human experiments without hesitation.”
“Don’t deny it. But the sacrifice of the few can save the many. After all, someone is bound to suffer. Isn’t it the duty of intelligence to save more people even at the cost of sacrifice? What would you do if there were parents with mentally retarded children in front of you? Can I still say something pretentious then?”
“you can do it.”
Arcane frowned as if in displeasure. But Shirone wasn’t being stubborn.
“As you said, if 10,000 people can be saved by sacrificing one person, it would be a reasonable choice. Even so, I will not sacrifice that one person.”
“If that happens, ten thousand people will die.”
“It is unavoidable.”
Shirone said with a firm look.
“Ten thousand people could die. However, even if such a situation arises, it is not an area that we as humans can intervene in. He’s arrogant to think he weighs people’s lives. Even if more people are sacrificed, we just have to do what we can. Then the day will come when we can save 10,000 people. What you are trying to do is no different from a dictator trying to stand above humans.”
Arcane realized that Shirone was his antipode. Can’t the few be sacrificed for the many? Some would call this a good thing, but if this actually happened, not many people would accept it. This is because humans are beings who wander in search of things that benefit them in the middle of good and evil. But Shirone was at the far end of the line. The cruel killer and the saint who saved mankind are all post-human. And both were equally persecuted by the public.
‘Your life won’t be smooth either. Even dying here will be a blessing to you.’
Wizards choose between good and evil based on their intellect. To Arcane, who believes that the effectiveness of evil advances humanity, Shirone is a future enemy that must be nipped in the bud.
“We are the kind that can’t get along. I’m sorry, but I have to die.”
Shirone took a step back. It was an Arcane that had clearly felt its power decline until just a moment ago, but now it was exuding the energy of a true great mage.
“Are you surprised, kid? Magic is a subtle thing.”
According to a study by the Magic Association, it is known that the mental fatigue of a wizard casting pure magic is equivalent to that of an ordinary person immersed in one task for 48 minutes.
However, Arcane ignored these arithmetic calculations and instantly increased his strength.
“Let’s finish with this. There will be no pain.”
A shadow rose from Arcane’s body and a black veil covered the sky. People were astonished by its enormous size. It was different in scale from the power of darkness that Canis showed off.
As Arcane raised his right hand, the veil came together in the form of a fist. Shirone was genuinely amazed. Judging by the size of his fists, a fall would blow off half the basin.
‘I can’t stop it. But I can’t avoid it.’
If the power of darkness is quantified, the force exerted by the unit cube (width, length, height 1 cm) is approximately 0.1 N, which is slightly better than that of an ant’s jaw joint. However, if the unit exceeded a billion units, everything on the ground could be wiped out with an enormous force of 1,000 tons.
“Stop being rude, Master.”
All eyes in the basin returned to the cliff. Alpheas stood with his hands behind his back. Then, a ray of light bent with a roar, and Thaad landed next to Alfeas.
“Teacher Thaad!”
A blush appeared on the faces of Shirone and the others. Just the arrival of Alpheas and Thaad made it feel like a thousand troops had been won. Thaad looked up at the power of darkness and cast a fire line. Streams of flame shot up in a double helix and converged into a huge ball of fire.
“wow… … .”
I couldn’t even open my eyes as the scenery around me was bleached to white light. However, Arcane offset the light that burned his retinas with the power of dark magic and stared straight ahead.
“Hmm.”
As I spread my palm toward the fire line, the power of darkness floating in the sky moved in the same motion and grabbed a huge fireball.
Chee Hee Hee!
Shirone shuddered. It was the first time something burned with such a huge sound. As the world plunged into darkness again, Thaad frowned and converted the Spirit Zone into an offensive type.
“Sheesh! Annoying inspiration… … !”
Alpheas raised his hand to stop it.
“Stop it, Thaad.”
“But Master… … .”
“It’s my job. It’s me and Arcane’s business. You want to leave it to me from here on out.”
Alpheas moved slowly. Then Arcane returned the power of darkness that stayed with the fire line turned off in the form of a veil and spread it across the sky.
“You are old, Alpheas. Well, even a wizard of time is just a human being in front of time.”
Alpheas ignored the first greeting in 40 years. At least not yet… … It was not the time for these two foolish, absent-minded old men to put an end to the past. Passing through hundreds of students, looking at the injured Eruki, Nade, and Shirone, he looked back at Ethella for the last time. He had bruises on his white skin that must have already come from a collision with Arcane.
“You worked hard, Ethella. It’s because I’m immoral. All I can say is that I’m sorry.”
“no. I’m sorry. We couldn’t save the students.”
Alpheas shook his head. When she came to see her teacher interview, she was puzzled. But to this day, she couldn’t be so proud of her own judgment of hiring her. If it wasn’t for her, she wouldn’t be in the situation where all of her students are safe.
“principal. be careful.”
Shirone said with a worried expression. If it was an arcane whose energy was exhausted, it was considered that Alfeas, a certified 4th grade, was worth a try. However, the current Arcane was arguably in the best condition.
Alpheas smiled as if he already knew.
“Don’t worry. There is no magic that violates the principle of equivalent exchange.”
“But Arcane must have mental power… … .”
“okay. would have recovered But it is also magic.”
“Is it magic?”
“Abyss-type magic controls memories. It was created by Arcane, and it is the magic that Arcane uses best. Is that correct, Master?”
Arcane snorted.
“You don’t seem to have dementia. By the way, the magic you received is a magic called Abyss Nova that is incomparable to that. I’ve experienced the effects myself, so I don’t need to tell you.”
“It was great magic. Thanks to that, it was nice to be able to recall old memories.”
“Don’t be bluffing. Subjects who fled or ran away in fright. I must have been weeping at least in tears.”
“You got it right. But while Master didn’t see you, you’ve become very weak. It’s hard enough to even cast Abyss Memory against children as young as 100 years old.”
Arcane was not angry. When Alfeas is calm, he himself is calm too. The 40-year-old hatred could not be resolved with mere words.
Alpheas turned his head to Shirone as if enjoying the afterglow of the night before the storm.
“Shirone. In order to cast magic, you need a momentary strong concentration. It’s like the average person spends the result of 1 hour of concentration in 1 second. That is why Arcane did this.”
Alpheas tapped his temple with his index finger and said.
“It was cast on his own head. The magic to erase memories.”
“ah… … .”
There was such a way. If you erase the memory of using your brain, the mental fatigue will disappear. Of course, it was inevitable that it would become functionally overloaded, but once in a while, it would be enough to restore mental strength.
Alpheas understood Shirone’s feelings. Viltor Arcane. He was a wizard who endured on the battlefield for 100 years with non-mainstream dark magic. He’s a grudge from the past. He had no choice but to acknowledge his skill no matter what.
“okay. It’s a bold and cool technique. Arcane is a wizard who lives in such a world. So remember you too. The one who doesn’t have a single last resort, he will never be able to disappear combat magic.”

Arcane made an annoyed expression.
“joy. you compliment me All passing dogs will laugh.”
“Are you okay? It is said that mental power has been restored, but in the end it is just an illusion of the brain. If you intend to add here, you cannot guarantee your life.”
There is no free magic in magic. The mental power recovered with the Abyss Memory was an equal exchange achieved at the risk of causing brain death.
“so? Are you trying to stop me after all?”
“If you back off, we can end it here. Maybe this is your last chance. So far, everyone is safe, so I can suggest something. But if you can’t let go of your tenacity, you have to pay the price.”
“Quack. Even now, the tongue is excellent. You pretend to be thinking about it, but in the end you only know yourself. Do you think your past will be covered if I step down? It’s already late. Not only those in this seat, but also the students affected by Abyss Nova have their ears open, so you will no longer be the principal.”
Shirone looked back at the students who had lost their memories. When the magic is lifted, everything that happened here will remain as a memory. Even if the battle ended safely, it couldn’t be a big deal.
“Chuck! Are you aware of the situation now? Why don’t we just kill them all here? If so, are you willing to overwrite it for me?”
Alpheas gently raised the corner of his mouth.
“One joke too.”
“Then why don’t you go with me? I am giving you one last chance. Shouldn’t Erina take care of what she left behind? Come on, look. the results I have achieved. It’s a magical organism harvester!”
Shirone and the others turned around to where Arcane pointed. Harvest was lying on the floor, strewn about like a rag.
“… … Well, it did look a little off. In any case, the experiment was successful. If you help me, I can achieve even higher results. And that is exactly what Erina really wanted.”
Upon hearing Erina’s name, Alpheas’ eyes lit up with a cool light.
“Master. Please grow up.”
Arcane finally revealed that he was going to live. They were having a trivial conversation, but in reality, it was all meaningless words. It was a bad relationship from the beginning.
“You think you can beat me? Principal? That’s not even funny. Pretending to be smart and making foolish decisions is still the same, Alpheas.”
The powers of darkness that spread in the air united again in the form of fists. Against him, Alpheas slowly raised both hands and prepared to cast magic.
“No, this is right. One foolish judgment is enough.”
Alpheas compressed the photons between his palms. Upon seeing the photon output that any wizard of light can cast, Arcane snorted in displeasure.
“Are you going to stop me with something like that? You have become weak, Alfeas.”
“You won’t know until you try.”
“Chuck! Wasn’t that the word you hated the most? Where has Alpheas gone who used to say that you should know before you try?”
“Wizards are those who live the future. Although his gun is gone, he is not as old as I am. Do you think I have not counted your 40 years?”
“Hoo. Did you foresee today? So what you prepared is only photon output?”
“Let’s finish with this.”
Alpheas raised both hands to the sky. Then, the photons between the palms compressed and became smaller than dust. At the same time, Arcane swung his fist. A huge power of darkness poured down to the ground. End with this. It was a blow that poured out all the resentments of 40 years.
Shirone and the others stared at the power of darkness falling at an incredible speed. When I saw it up close, it was much bigger than I expected.
Alpheas’s hands slowly fell down. The movements of his arms continued like flowing water, and then began to split into dozens of afterimages. The eyes of those who watched were filled with wonder.
‘what?’
The afterimage of Alpheas moved terribly slowly. The photons compressed in his palm disappeared in an instant. Even during that time, the Power of Darkness had not yet reached half the distance.
Shirone couldn’t move a single finger. No, he couldn’t even breathe. Time is passing slowly. Only a drop of photon, smaller than a speck of dust, was moving at the speed of light.
The photon plunged into the great darkness. The wave-like ripples slowly oscillated and moved away as slowly as time slowed down.
and the next moment.
Flash!
There was a powerful explosion of light that made the world a blank slate.
The power of darkness was torn apart and spread. The light that spread throughout the magic school weakened from the center and then disappeared in the form of a ring.
When time returned to normal, Shirone and the others looked up at the sky with absurd expressions. A pale moon hung in the night sky where even the clouds had disappeared.
‘What kind of magic is this?’
It does not have physical force like Photon Cannon, nor does it have durability like Shining. It was a magic that was created to explode the strongest light in only a moment.
Arcane’s impression was distorted.
“Alpheas… … .”
“It’s the magic of the Big Bang. It’s embarrassing to put it on the association, but I think it’s good enough as a farewell gift.”
“surely… … You didn’t just run away for 40 years.”
Arcane realized what Alfeas was aiming for. It is not a magic developed as an antidote to dark magic. It wasn’t even about getting over yourself.
Alfeas only assumed this moment, this situation, and polished the Big Bang for 40 years.
“It was pretty good, for you.”
Arcane’s knees thumped and hit the ground. Due to the aftermath of the Abyss Memory, her brain function was seriously impaired.
“It will be good, Alfeas. The 50-year bet paid off. Since you have defeated the Arcanes of the world, your reputation will rise. Do you want to become the archmage of your dreams?”
Alpheas shook his head. Even at this moment, he is obsessed with superiority and inferiority. Knowing that it was the driving force behind the creation of today’s Arcane, on the other hand, felt sorry for him.
“Master is no longer the archmage. It was called that 50 years ago. That’s enough time for a 10th-class newbie to become a 2nd-class archmage. Our time is already over. The world has changed, and I am too old to be ambitious. How can you not know that?”
A vein stood on Arcane’s temple. Even though he was defeated, his years of living enough to receive admonitions from his disciples were not insignificant.
“Why do you think you are an arrogant Alpheas? You’d think you’d been caught up in some unfortunate misfortune. let me tell you the truth you are not a genius I’m just a lowly wizard running away from misfortune.”
Arcane gave strength to his shaking legs and stood up.
“Old? I became an archmage at your age. How about being honest? I don’t have one. Aren’t you making excuses because you don’t have the confidence to go up any further?”
“It’s not just about going up. As you get older, you should have appropriate introspection. But Master is still no different from a boy who only pursues sweet ambitions.”
“Chuck! Foolish Alpheas! What are you so afraid of? Take a step back and see. There is no categorical imperative in this world that says it should be!”
A terrifying aura exploded from Arcane’s body again. Realizing that her memory had been erased again with Abyss magic, Alfeas raised her eyes in surprise. The brain would withstand one Abyss memory, but the second was death with an almost absolute probability.
“Stupid old man! Are you determined to die?”
Arcane responded with a sneer and cast a dark power. The shadows beneath their feet extended to cover the basin, lifting the amnesic students into the air and moving them to the cliff.
This time, even Alpheas couldn’t help but be terrified.
“Stop it! It’s just pointless killing! What the hell will you be left with like this!”
“The winner’s satisfaction remains.”
“You fool! I want to win even at that age! I don’t think you’ll ever be a boy!”
“You foolish Alfeas. Listen carefully.”
At the end of his life, Arcane said with a confident smile.
“Wizards… … He is forever a boy.”
400 people captured by the power of darkness flew off the cliff as if scooped up with a gourd. Alpheas couldn’t understand. To use the mental strength he gained in exchange for his life on such a foolish thing.
‘What the hell drives you? What does this stupid conviction bring?’
Anyway, now wasn’t the time to care about Arcane. Alfeas, who poured all his energy into the Big Bang magic, hurriedly turned to his side and shouted.
“Save the students!”
As soon as the instructions were given, the Thaad turned into a flash and flew away. Shirone followed, and Nade and Eruki also teleported to the cliff. It was 400 people. You can’t save everything anyway. However, the situation was so urgent that even such a thought was a luxury.
Thaad descended halfway up the cliff and created a wall of air with air-type magic. However, he had to make a wall of at least 50 square meters, so the thickness had to be thin.
In the end, a hole was pierced in the weak part of the durability, and the students poured down.
Under Thaad, Eruki and Nade were active. But it was too late to turn things around. Tears welled up at the sight of excellent students falling from children to seniors.
“Damn it! Damn, damn!”
Eruki looked at the sky through his hazy vision. The stars in the night sky twinkled, and a single flash descended vertically.
“Shirone!”
The flash passed even Eruki and kept going down. A red-haired girl caught the eye of Shirone, who was moving at high speed.
“Amy!”
Hearing Shirone’s voice, Amy looked away. Since it was an impossible reaction when affected by Abyss Nova, Shirone shouted again with a glimmer of hope.
“Amy! Wake!”
‘mental?’
Humans are thinking beings. Because he finds it harder not to think than to think. However, if you get caught in Abyss Nova, which blocks your memory, the source of your thoughts will not be provided.
“Amy! Amy!”
Still, Amy could think.
Because she is Amy of the Karmis family.
“Amy! Come to your senses!”
‘It’s annoying. Please don’t do this.’
“it’s me! I mean Shirone!”
‘Shirone?’
What did you mean? It was an unknown word. But Amy couldn’t let go of the three syllables that kept tickling her brain.
‘What is it, what is it? what was it I’m very curious.’
Amy kept thinking. As electricity spread through her cerebral cortex, she began to seek out information. Finally, a pattern flashed and the meaning of Shirone rushed into my body.
‘Oh right. Shirone! It was Shirone.’
Amy took a deep breath as if she thought she was dying of frustration. At the same time, her eyes burned red, triggering her crimson eyes ability. Abyss Nova burned in an instant, and her memories flooded in.
‘What an idiot! What am I doing?’
Her specialty is her red face. Scientifically, she says it is self-image memory.
People of the Karmis family can return their condition to a specific point in time when the red eyes are manifested.
For example, it is possible to save the action of lifting a sword and slashing, and repeat the same action infinitely without errors. Moreover, since it is an area of feeling like a schema, the correction of errors was also immediate.
The famous saying, ‘One mistake is the foundation for progress, two mistakes are the shame of the family’, was the word that revealed their confidence.
‘what? What condition are you in now?’
Amy analyzed errors at the neural level based on self-image memory. She is currently in the sphere of influence of gravitational acceleration. Her center of gravity tilted 87.6 degrees and her heart beat 1.6 times faster.
‘It’s going down.’
I didn’t really have any complaints about that. I saw Shirone descending on a flash of light. He remembered what had happened to him. How could he forget about you?

‘Like an idiot… … really stupid… … !’
He came to me first, and I gave him coffee, but he threw away his hand coldly. Amy closed her eyes tightly as if turning away from the scenes dotted with her regret. She and she shouted with all her might.
“Shirone!”
Shirone smiled. It was fortunate that Amy had her memories back. At least for the last moment, she is able to leave as a Shirone who remains in someone’s memory.
“Thank you, Amy.”
Shirone’s tears fell down Amy’s cheeks.
‘Why are you crying, Shirone?’
Amy was anxious. Something went wrong. Then, the moment she saw the will to live slowly slipping out of Shirone’s eyes, she realized.
“Shirone! no!”
“Sorry. I couldn’t keep my promise.”
Shirone embraced Amy and fully opened her immortal function. As consciousness expanded to infinity, the ego began to fade like water.
‘Hello everyone… … .’
Father, mother, members of the Ogent family, and friends at school. Shirone could laugh because she was loved by so many people. A huge light flooded the bottom of the cliff. Falling students, Eruki, Nade, and even Thaad were swept away by the brilliance and disappeared.
The next moment, a huge flash of light shot up vertically.
It was a mass teleport that moved as many as 400 people at the same time.
‘Ah, that’s right.’
Lying on the ground, Arcane watched as the flash of light soared over the cliff was scattered in dozens of directions. It was only at the last moment that I was convinced. where she was And what a wonderful life she had.
‘It’s a playground that I regret playing for the rest of my life. Isn’t that right, Alfeas?’
The legendary archmage who dominated the world passed away just like that.
“Master?”
Canis was dazed in front of Arcane’s corpse. Wasn’t he still a disciple? But he left without even leaving a will, doing what he wanted to do until the end.
“Was it really nothing? Were we just tools?”
Canis ran to Arcane and shook her collar.
“wake up! How could this be! I’d rather die! Why are you leaving me alone!”
Arin approached Canis with sad eyes. His reflection in menarche was that of a man made of liquid like sludge. The shape did not stay still for a moment, spreading like a liquid and then rising again in the form of a human being.
“No, Canis. I didn’t die because of you. That person took advantage of us. The villain of the world.”
“Hehe, what’s wrong? It looks like you’ve realized it now.”
Harvest said in a muffled voice.
“Yes, Canis. everything died because of you Arcane, I will die, and someday Arin will die too.”
Arin, who was glaring at Harvest, hurriedly turned to Canis. As expected, she was shocked, and as the human form collapsed, she was released into muddy water and stuck to the floor.
“why? What did I do? Living in Radum? Is it because you are an unlucky child?”
“Because I am weak.”
Harvest’s conclusion was simple.
“How long are you going to live hoping that others will notice you? There is no such thing as saying that you have to live like this, or that you have to die like this. Arcane just lived his own life.”
Arcane sacrificed his life in exchange for his evil beliefs. Harvest fulfilled the contract as a magical creature, even choosing to self-destruct.
‘I am… … What did you want to die for?’
couldn’t find anything Blindfolded, she was nothing more than a wildling colt. It was a life made up of all kinds of shells.
“Like Master… … .”
“Yes, and like that boy.”
Shirone was lying in the middle of the 400 students. He said he wouldn’t hurt anyone. And he stood by his convictions to the end.
Canis approached Harvest and checked his condition.
“How are you?”
“If you ask me, I will die. Because if you don’t parasitize life, you can’t live.”
Arin said.
“All you have to do is sign a master/servant contract with me. Canis will not be able to hold on because her mental strength is exhausted.”
Harvest shook his head.
“I’m sorry, but that’s not possible.”
“what? why? It will perish at this rate!”
“Because my master is Canis.”
Harvest’s words pierced Canis’ chest. It was time for him to raise the banner of his convictions. Will I be able to survive? Either way, both would die.
“Harvest. I will accept you as a vassal. But I will not forgive you for betraying me twice.”
“Quack. You know. master.”
“Canis! It’s too dangerous! If it goes wrong… … !”
Arin stopped talking. As the mud soaked into the shape of Canis, which was made of liquid, it was becoming hard. Will he one day be able to gain an unshakable heart? Like the look of Shirone she looked up to with her menarche.
Canis put her hand on Harvest. As the subordination contract progressed, Harvest began to suck up what little life force was left. His eyes closed as his consciousness fell into darkness.
Away from Canis and the others, Alpheas stood sadly. He saved the students by dying, but he lost too much.
“principal.”
Ethella was of the same mind. Starting today, there will be big changes in the magic school. The students who have regained their memories will fall into confusion, and the mistake Alpheas made 40 years ago will also come to the surface.
“Ethella, I am a sinner.”
“Don’t beat yourself up too much. If even mistakes are unacceptable, human existence itself is a sin.”
Alpheas shook his head. Anyone can make mistakes. But with everything comes responsibility. Like Arcane, he had no intention of running away.
“He is the one who raised dark magic to the ranks of great magic. Harvest can be said to be an innovation in the field of memory transfer. Abyss Nova will be registered as a prescribed magic in the Magic Association.”
In front of Arcane’s corpse, Alpheas put his hands together and mourned his death.
“Arcane, the Archmage who was always a boy. The magical path you have walked will be passed on to posterity.”
Alpheas opened his eyes and looked relieved. Ethella, on the other hand, was still worried. It was an incident in which her entire school life was threatened, so it was not a problem to be dealt with within the school.
“Principal, what do you plan to do next?”
“What can I say? I am also in a position to wait for treatment. Why don’t we leave the matter of punishment to the experts and praise the hero of the day instead?”
Alpheas looked around to find Shirone. He was a boy with a knack for surprising people the more he looked. He couldn’t guarantee that even he could move 400 people at the same time.
“I’m in trouble!”
Where Shirone fell, Amy was weeping.
Feeling the unusual atmosphere, Alpheas and Ethella hurried their steps. Eruki and Nade were running from afar.
But before they even arrived, Amy shouted first.
“Shirone is not breathing!”
Meet God (1)
Syrone has spread enormously and also faded. He was permeating everything, forgetting even the lingering attachment to the world. Then some powerful force pulled him to a point. If there is more to humans than life, it is safe to call it the hijacking of the soul.
“omg! omg!”
As Shirone’s mind was reassembled, her memories before attempting the Immortal Function came back. Trembling for a moment at the fear of his death, he let out a rough breath and checked his body condition. He seemed to have no special abnormalities except that he was not wearing any clothes.
“Where are you?”
It was a space full of white. I couldn’t feel the distance in this place where the monochromatic scenery was infinitely spread out. I tried to move slowly, but I didn’t even think I was moving.
‘It’s very strange. It feels like all five senses are paralyzed.’
Shirone suddenly came up with a unique idea. As an experiment, he slowly bent his knees and stepped on the soles of his feet as if he were going up a flight of stairs. Surprisingly, his body floated.
“what?”
Shirone endlessly climbed the stairs. Pausing for a moment and looking around him, he was speechless.
“… … .”
I didn’t feel like I was up there. Wherever I moved, it was just the same white scenery as before.
“There is no distance.”
Space cannot exist if it cannot be measured. Shirone went down this time to confirm the hypothesis. The prediction was correct. No matter where it moved, it didn’t move.
When I couldn’t find the meaning to move anymore, I heard a woman’s voice.
“awesome. Do you understand the meaning of space? You deserve to be here too.”
Shirone did not look back. There was no concept of direction anyway.
“Who are you? Am I dead?”
A beautiful woman stepped out of a gap in the white landscape. When the sense of distance arose, the scenery changed in an instant. A gigantic temple he had never seen before was looking down on Shirone as if it would crush him.
“wow… … .”
It was on an unimaginable scale. Even ancient temples were not so large. Hundreds of pillars supported the ceiling, each about two kilometers tall.
“Here is… … .”
“Nice to meet you, Shirone. I was waiting for you.”
It was a woman with light blue hair that reached her ankles. Since Shirone was born, she has never seen such a beautiful woman. It wasn’t about her looks. value of existence. Her value here was absolute, just as the man she fell in love with felt that her lover was the most beautiful in her world.
“Oops!”
Shirone hurriedly covered her face. Unaware of his nakedness, he proudly exposed his body.
“Whoops. You have nothing to be ashamed of. Because this isn’t your world. Your body is still in the original world.”
The clothes were instantly put on by the woman waving her hand. Shirone stared blankly at her own figure until she finally gave up. There was only one thing that came to mind right away.
“Is this the underworld?”
“no. The underworld is not. It’s just a spot (dot) different from where you used to live.”
Shirone tilted her head. A point is one dimension without space. A point moves to become a line, a line moves to become a plane, and a plane moves to become a three-dimensional space.
“no way… … ?”
Shirone recalled the white space she had just stayed in.
“that’s right. that’s the spot. It is not that there is no space, but that it is compressed to infinity.”
According to her words, it was natural that she couldn’t feel the distance. But even though she is trapped in 1D, her own body is 3D. If she could measure the distance between her right and left arms, wouldn’t space exist?
“aha. It means that there is a third dimension in the first dimension.”
“Your insight is great, too. that’s right. That is the essence of space-time. No matter how huge the world is, it’s just a dot when you see it from a distance. Conversely, if you go inside, no matter how small a dot, an infinite world is unfolding.”
Shirone was finally able to calm down. In a world where logical conversation was possible, there was no need to be afraid, even in the afterlife.
“Then who are you?”
The woman laughed like an idiot. It felt eerie, but even that was beautiful to Shirone. Because she is the most valuable being right here.
“I am a god.”
* * *
The magic school was in a state of total chaos.
It took eight full hours just to collect Arcane’s body and send the students back to their lodgings.
The students were still lying in their rooms with their memories blocked. If the teaching staff regains their memories, the work will gain momentum, but thinking about the commotion that will happen when all the students wake up makes me nervous.
To make matters worse, Canis and Arin, the suspects in the case, disappeared, so Nade, Eruki, and Amy were the only ones taking care of Shirone, who eventually moved to the infirmary.
In fact, the word caring didn’t fit. Shirone wasn’t breathing and his heart stopped. But he never put the word death in his mouth.

“Shirone… … .”
Amy held Shirone’s hand with her eyes swollen from crying. The teachers were also in a state of distraught, so no one came to see them. No, maybe he had already admitted that Shirone was dead.
But Amy shook her head and denied it. She couldn’t believe that Shirone was dead. She had too many obscure corners to be called an obsession.
Nade offered words of comfort.
“Senior, don’t worry. Shirone will be back.”
“that’s right. Common sense makes no sense. Why the hell are you dying? If you were going to die from casting Mass Teleport, it shouldn’t have been activated from the start. Something strange must have happened to Shirone.”
Eruki frowned in disapproval. She himself has been by her side all night, but he has done nothing more foolish than to mistake the dead for living.
“If you’re going to argue that way, Arcane should have lived too. Just casting magic is enough to kill me.”
“The situation is different with Arcane! Shirone completely opened the immortal function. That has nothing to do with declining brain function!”
“Anyway, it’s the same as exceeding the capacity. Humans can die from any variable. Whether he is dead or alive is what matters, and it is not reasonable to question why he died.”
Nade frowned. Even if it was true, she had things to say and things to say in front of her girlfriends. Just as he was about to shoot, Amy approached Eruki with her cold eyes.
“You, you are as unlucky as ever.”
Eruki looked at Amy with his chin resting on the table. Her eyes were burning red.
‘It’s the Karmis family. Well, if it’s red eyes, it’s immune to spirit-type magic.’
The red face is also a famous trait on the continent. Anti-magic was the only thing that could invade their minds, so it was understandable that they escaped from Abyss Nova. But his thoughts were just there, and soon he turned his gaze away as if he was not interested.
“It’s a bad habit to blame others when you feel bad.”
“no. You are really setting the mood on fire. What are you? Are you really Shirone’s friend? How could you think Shirone is dead?”
“I didn’t think he was dead. They said she was dead.”
“That’s a worse word! And you, how are you talking about Class Five?”
“If you feel bad, refer it to the student council. It’s okay if you get punished.”
Amy couldn’t stand it and approached. She then grabbed Eruki by the collar and lifted him up with the power of schema. Eruki’s legs fell off the ground.
“Say it again. But this time I’ll have to be honest.”
“Oh, you are scared.”
There was no emotion in Eruki’s eyes. She just stared down at Amy with her empty eyes. However, she was the kind of person who would not hesitate to do anything if Amy turned inside out as well.
“Do the same thing I say. Shirone is not dead. Otherwise, you will end up lying next to Shirone.”
“Shirone is dead.”
“Shirone is not dead! Follow me quickly!”
“Shirone is dead.”
Amy’s crimson eyes flickered. Engineered the accuracy of his punches with his self-image memory, he targeted Eruki’s 3rd and 4th teeth and punched him. However, even Eruki’s expression did not change. He was about to stop exactly in front of his lips as he saw his acceleration diminish.
As expected, Amy stopped moving just before hitting. Eruki said dryly as he watched her fist tremble with her resentment.
“Ah, I’m glad.”
“Do not be ridiculous! Unlucky Servant. People like you don’t even understand the meaning of my stopping my fists.”
Amy couldn’t hit Eruki. No matter how much she hated her, she was Shirone’s friend.
“It means to stop the fist. To the extent that I just drained my strength needlessly?”
Sparks flew in Amy’s eyes.
“So, with that gaping mouth, are you saying Shirone is dead too? I know that? People like you don’t even deserve to have friends.”
“Maybe. But do you deserve it?”
“What is it? this is real… … !”
Amy pulled her collar again and raised her fist. Then, Eruki frowned at her for the first time and shook off her hand that was holding her collar.
“Ah, sir!”
As Amy looked at her while shaking her hands, Eruki walked over to the bed and pointed at Shirone.
“You are the one who is pitiful. Does this look really alive? I can’t breathe, my heart has stopped! But the truth is, you guys are talking nonsense, like saying you’re alive, saying there’s something strange going on, what kind of friends are you guys!”
“Then what! Shirone is in a situation like this, what are you asking me to do!”
“So think about it!”
Eruki shouted with an excited expression that was not usually seen.
“If you think you are alive, do you think the dead will come to life? If you’re in the mood to talk nonsense like that, think of a way to bring the dead back to life!”
Amy, who bit her lip looking for something to say, finally realized and bowed her head sullenly. Eruki was right. Shirone was mathematically dead.
Nade said with a sad expression.
“I know what you mean. But, Eruki, how do you live? Like a way to bring the dead back to life… … There can be no way.”
“Hmph, that’s your limit.”
Eruki closed the door until there was a bang and went outside. Silence fell in the infirmary. Nade was relieved as Amy sat in her chair and covered her face.
“Seniors. Don’t hate me too much. Eruki is also doing that because he is frustrated.”
“it’s okay. I don’t want to worry about a child like that. To think of a way to raise the dead? Why don’t you know that’s a bigger wound?”
Nade couldn’t answer that either. It may be an act like Eruki, but it was also true that I felt sorry for such a friend today.
After leaving the infirmary, Eruki frowned as he walked down the hallway. The two people I most wanted to see were waiting. Canis was leaning her back against the wall, and Arin seemed uneasy to find where to put her gaze.
As the person who led this situation, we have to strictly monitor it, but the problem was that the current situation was not relaxed enough to pay attention to them.
Of course, it was the same that Eruki didn’t have any composure. Had he decided to run away anyway, he would have run away right away. Even so, he couldn’t escape the eyes of the Magic Association.
“Did you come to salt people? Or are you going to apologize now?”
Canis bounced on her back and fell off the wall.
“It’s both. I came to do salting and also to apologize. It’s okay to die in battle, but it’s embarrassing that Shirone sacrificed herself for something meaningless. But I think you got the timing wrong.”
He must have heard the sound of fighting with Amy outside. Eruki scratched his head annoyedly at the thought that he had shown a bad appearance and said.
“Good idea. If you go in now, you won’t see anything good. The girl in the infirmary will start by breaking your leg. Try your best anyway. I go.”
Canis followed Eruki’s eyes as she passed by.
“It doesn’t matter. Getting the timing wrong means that the opportunity is gone. How can I apologize to someone who is already dead?”
Eruki, who stopped walking, looked back at Canis and widened her eyes terribly.
“what?”
“I totally agree with your opinion. dead is dead Seeing him making a fuss with the corpse lying down made me want to apologize.”
Eruki thought for a moment, then burst out laughing.
“You speak well on the subject of dying and coming back to life. who’s idea is that? you? Or a shadow?”
“… … Do you want to play here?”
“Shirone is, from my point of view, a pretty annoying friend.”
When Eruki brought up a sudden story, Canis’s forehead crumpled.
“Actually, I am a very strange and bad guy. So I decided to limit myself. In other words, Shirone is like my lock.”
“joy. What a weak idea.”
“is it? Well, if it wasn’t for Shirone, I don’t know if I would have thought of this. Anyway, there is no such Shirone now. So I want you to be careful with your words from now on.”
Feeling something from Eruki, Arin took a step back.
“Because I am different from Shirone. You can do anything crazy if you put your mind to it. So you’d better pray that Shirone will surely come alive and dry me.”
Eruki’s eyes began to shine as he glared at Canis. Sparks from her cerebrum shone through her eyeballs.
“If Shirone ends like this, I will kill you first, no matter what.”
As Canis’ mental channel opened, Harvest’s brainwaves came through.
-Canis, it’s a warning level. Caught in targeting
-know. You already knew what a Servant was.
– It’s not like that. The calculation speed is incredibly fast. It is estimated to be more than 10,000 times faster than our mental channels when calculated from the movement of the Spirit Zone.
Canis couldn’t believe it. The exchange of opinions with Harvest is faster than the speed of thought. 10,000 times faster there was a speed that could not even be imagined by human common sense.
-What level is that?
-This is the amount of information enough to analyze all events that occur in the city for 3 seconds. You need a special strategy to deal with them. But we are criminals. Causing an accident here has the potential to put things at a disadvantage.
Canis didn’t want to back down. This stubbornness was the reason he was selected as Arcane’s disciple, but the timing was not good. Arin intervened while Harvest desperately tried to stop him.
“But doesn’t that mean you also think Shirone isn’t dead?”
Eruki’s Spirit Zone disappeared. Arin, who was watching her live through menarche, felt that her breath was now free. Eruki took control of his heart. He must be cool than anyone else. It was enough for the idiots in the infirmary to get swept away by emotions.
“Shirone is dead. If you don’t admit the facts, there will be no solution. I’m just thinking rationally.”
“no. You believe Shirone is alive. Maybe more than the two people in that room.”
Eruki made an impression. The Servant had the strongest ability to calculate the causal rate of an event. There was no room for illogical sensibility to intervene.
“What are you talking about knowing about me?”
“I have the ability called menarche. We perceive everything as if we are seeing it for the first time. So I can’t remember the shape of things. It looks different every time.”
“so? What do you mean by that?”
“I can see your emotions in my eyes. In a completely different form from what other people see.”
“I am fine. dead is dead There is no room for emotion.”
“no. different.”
Arin shook his head.
“Because you are crying with a very sad expression right now.”
Eruki couldn’t answer.
As Arin said, a hundred words were useless in front of menarche.
That night.
The door to the infirmary opened slowly.
Amy was lying on the cot, exhausted from crying, and Nade was napping in a chair in the corner.
Eruki approached Shirone. Sleeping and dying feel different. Seeing Shirone’s cold face made me feel like I was going to collapse.
In the morning, teachers will come to check on Shirone. To hold a funeral, embalming would be done first, but then it had to be seen that there was no way to save Shirone anymore.
Eruki managed to control his emotions and took out the scalpel hidden in his arms.
‘I will definitely save you.’
I looked at Amy and Nade, but there was no sign of getting up. She’s been there for 2 days already and she’s been extremely stressed so no wonder. Only then did Eruki use a scalpel.
The blade reflected in the moonlight cut through Shirone’s skin.
